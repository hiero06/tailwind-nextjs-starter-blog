## Jon Bon Jovi and Chris Pratt Spotlight Super Bowl LX: Exploring Bon Jovi's Deep Roots with the Patriots

Super Bowl LX featured the New England Patriots facing the Seattle Seahawks, but the excitement commenced well before kickoff with star-studded pre-game entertainment. Setting the tone for the epic matchup were celebrity team ambassadors: rock legend Jon Bon Jovi introduced the Patriots, while Hollywood star Chris Pratt championed the Seahawks.

This tradition of celebrity team introductions highlights deep, often surprising connections between artists, athletes, and major franchises, and delves into why Jon Bon Jovi has become such an intrinsic part of the New England Patriots’ fabric, transcending typical celebrity fandom.

### Super Bowl LX Celebrity Introductions and Pregame Powerhouses

The 60th anniversary of the Super Bowl, held at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, was celebrated with an elaborate pre-game ceremony featuring both musical icons and celebrated personalities. Beyond the main musical performances, the introduction of the competing teams—the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks—was a significant spectacle.

The Patriots were officially introduced by Jon Bon Jovi, a long-time friend of owner Robert Kraft, providing a high-energy start for New England fans. Meanwhile, the Seattle Seahawks were introduced by actor Chris Pratt, a choice that resonated strongly due to Pratt's ties to the Pacific Northwest region, energizing the crowd eagerly awaiting the opening kickoff.

In addition to the celebrity team introductions, the pregame coverage began at noon ET, anchored by expert analysis, spotlights, and deep dives before the opening ceremony commenced at 6 p.m. ET.

### Key Highlights of Super Bowl LX Pregame Festivities

The opening ceremony at Super Bowl LX was replete with memorable musical and cultural moments, effectively setting the stage for the matchup between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks.

#### Team Ambassadors: Jon Bon Jovi and Chris Pratt

The tradition of having celebrities introduce the teams continued at Super Bowl LX, drawing intense focus to the team representatives. Jon Bon Jovi, despite his deep roots in New Jersey, served as the face of the New England Patriots, owing to his decades-long relationship with the franchise's inner circle. In contrast, Chris Pratt, the actor who grew up not far from Seattle, energized the stadium as the ambassador for the Seahawks, leveraging his regional connection.

#### National Anthem Performance by Charlie Puth

Pop star Charlie Puth performed "The Star-Spangled Banner," bringing his noted perfect pitch and vocal range to the performance. Puth, a Grammy-nominated artist known for hits like "See You Again," called the anthem one of the "hardest to sing" pieces of music. Puth became the second New Jersey native to perform the song at the Super Bowl, following the legendary Whitney Houston in 1991, stating he was inspired by her iconic rendition.

#### Brandi Carlile and Coco Jones Take the Stage

The pregame opening ceremony also featured two other powerful musical moments. Grammy-winning artist Brandi Carlile sang “America the Beautiful,” describing the song as one about a beautiful country that “ebbs and flows in terms of hope.” Earlier in the ceremony, singer and actress Coco Jones performed “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” commonly referred to as the Black national anthem, which the NFL has played before games since 2020.

### Public Buzz and A-List Super Bowl Weekend Reactions

The star power surrounding Super Bowl LX extended far beyond the field, generating substantial buzz throughout the weekend. Michael Rubin’s high-profile Fanatics Super Bowl Party was one of the most sought-after events in San Francisco, attracting an impressive roster of celebrities and NFL figures.

Both Jon Bon Jovi and Patriots owner Robert Kraft, accompanied by his wife Dana Blumberg, were among the earliest high-profile attendees. Jon Bon Jovi was spotted chatting with Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, a testament to the access and integration the rock star enjoys within the professional football establishment.

The Fanatics event also featured performances by Cardi B, SZA, and Travis Scott, showcasing the extensive crossover between high-tier sports and popular entertainment. These gatherings set an electric atmosphere ahead of Sunday’s game between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks.

### Deep Ties: Jon Bon Jovi as a Patriots Fixture and Chris Pratt’s Seattle Roots

The choice of celebrity introducers was not arbitrary, but rather a nod to established loyalties and regional connections, especially evident in Jon Bon Jovi’s unique relationship with the Patriots organization.

#### Jon Bon Jovi’s History with the Patriots

Jon Bon Jovi’s allegiance to the New England Patriots is rooted in deep personal friendships that span over three decades. His fandom originally began through his connection to former coaches Bill Parcells and Bill Belichick. Notably, he developed a "very dear" friendship with Patriots owner Robert Kraft, starting in 1996.

This enduring bond has granted the New Jersey icon exceptional access; Bon Jovi has spent decades as a fixture in the Patriots’ inner circle, watching from Kraft’s luxury suite and even receiving two of the team’s Super Bowl rings. Their relationship goes beyond friendship, as Kraft has also provided Bon Jovi with personal business mentorship.

#### The ‘Livin’ On a Prayer’ Tradition

The depth of Bon Jovi’s connection is cemented by the tradition of playing "Livin’ on a Prayer" at Gillette Stadium. This tradition is a staple of the stadium experience, often occurring in the fourth quarter. When the audio is intentionally cut, nearly 66,000 fans spontaneously belt out the chorus a cappella—a moment that solidifies the band's integral role within the franchise’s history.

#### Chris Pratt’s Connection to the Seahawks

In contrast to Bon Jovi’s history of deep organizational friendship, Chris Pratt’s role for the Seahawks represented regional pride. The actor, known for his work in major movie franchises, grew up near Seattle, making him a fitting ambassador rooted in the region to represent the team as they took the field against the New England Patriots.

### The Cultural Significance and the Super Bowl Legacy

Super Bowl LX served as a major cultural marker, fusing sports achievements with celebrity firepower. The selection of figures like Jon Bon Jovi and Chris Pratt as introducers highlights the importance of personal narratives and regional loyalties in amplifying the spectacle of the NFL’s biggest game.

The extensive pregame programming, including Hall of Fame coach Tony Dungy anchoring coverage from Alcatraz Island, showcased the NFL's ambition to transform the event into an all-day entertainment experience. From the musical performances to the historic coin toss using Benjamin Franklin's Libertas Americana medal, the event aimed to be monumental.

Following the emotional pregame ceremony and team introductions, global attention shifted to the highly anticipated Apple Music Super Bowl Halftime Show, headlined by Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny. His performance, promoted as a grand celebration, continued the trend of showcasing diverse, global musical talent, making it a truly high-profile event for the more than 100 million viewers who tuned in.

From the powerful vocals of Charlie Puth, Brandi Carlile, and Coco Jones, to the legendary presence of Jon Bon Jovi and the regional pride brought by Chris Pratt, Super Bowl LX delivered a pre-game show worthy of its 60th anniversary. This electrifying ceremony perfectly set the stage for the highly anticipated matchup between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks.
