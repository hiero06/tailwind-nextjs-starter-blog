### Background and Career

Sam Rivers was a founding member of Limp Bizkit, a band that emerged from Jacksonville, Florida's vibrant underground music scene in 1994. His musical journey began in middle school, where he initially played tuba before transitioning to bass and guitar. This shift was influenced by his friend John Otto, a jazz drummer.

The spark for Limp Bizkit ignited when Rivers befriended future frontman Fred Durst, who had scouted Rivers while he was playing for another local band, Malachi Sage. The trio of Durst, Rivers, and Otto then laid the groundwork for the band.

The band's permanent and highly successful lineup was solidified in 1996 with the addition of guitarist Wes Borland and turntablist DJ Lethal. Rivers played a crucial role in establishing Limp Bizkit’s signature nu metal sound, a dynamic blend of hip hop, industrial rock, funk, and alternative metal.

In 2015, Rivers briefly stepped away from the band due to severe health issues, later revealing he had developed liver disease from excessive drinking. Following a successful liver transplant, he rejoined Limp Bizkit in 2018, continuing to perform and contribute until his untimely death. During his hiatus, Rivers also explored production, working with Jacksonville bands like Burn Season and The Embraced, further showcasing his diverse musical talents.
