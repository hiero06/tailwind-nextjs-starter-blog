## NYC Braces for Historic Snowstorm: Potential School Closures Monday, City Mobilizes Under Mayor Mamdani

New York City is on high alert as a potentially historic winter snowstorm, coupled with extreme cold, is forecast to strike starting this Sunday, January 25, 2026. Under Mayor Zohran Kwame Mamdani's leadership, city agencies are fully mobilized, coordinating a comprehensive citywide response to safeguard all New Yorkers.

### Event Overview

New York City is bracing for a significant winter snowstorm starting this Sunday, January 25, 2026, expected to bring heavy snowfall, hazardous travel conditions, and the city's coldest sustained temperatures in eight years. The National Weather Service has issued a Winter Storm Warning, predicting 10-12 inches of snow, with localized accumulations potentially soaring to 14 inches.

Mayor Zohran Kwame Mamdani has affirmed his administration's full mobilization, with all city agencies working around the clock in preparation. From pre-salting streets to maintaining constant public communication, the city's mission is unequivocal: to safeguard New Yorkers. The Mayor urged residents to stay informed by texting NOTIFYNYC to 692-692, avoid non-essential travel, and remain home whenever possible, emphasizing the importance of community solidarity.

### Key Highlights & Standouts

#### NYC Schools: Closure Decisions and Warming Centers

While Mayor Mamdani's decision regarding general NYC public school closures for Monday is expected before noon on Sunday, all Public School Athletic League activities, special education Weekend Academy, and other school building programming have been canceled for Sunday. Significantly, high schools across all five boroughs, already scheduled for a professional learning day closure on Monday, will be activated as vital warming centers.

These warming centers will provide safe, heated indoor spaces and will be accessible through at least Monday evening. Locations include Gompers Campus and DeWitt Clinton Campus in the Bronx; Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis High School and Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics Campus in Manhattan; Midwood High School and Urban Assembly for Law and Justice in Brooklyn; Jamaica Campus and Long Island City High School in Queens; and Curtis High School and New Dorp High School on Staten Island.

#### Mayor Mamdani's Proactive Leadership

Mayor Zohran Kwame Mamdani has adopted a highly visible and proactive approach, announcing comprehensive citywide preparations in advance of the winter storm. His administration is coordinating responses across numerous agencies, reaffirming its commitment to the safety of all New Yorkers. Mamdani also emphasized existing policies that deny ICE agents access to schools, hospitals, and city properties without a judicial warrant. This ensures a protective environment for all residents, including those benefiting from his recently announced free childcare policy.

#### Extensive Citywide Mobilization

New York City's robust response involves a vast network of agencies. The Department of Sanitation began pre-salting streets on Friday, deploying approximately 2,000 workers and preparing 700 salt spreaders and 2,200 plows. The FDNY and NYPD will maintain full emergency response capabilities; the FDNY, in particular, is increasing staffing, activating thawing apparatus, and adding ambulances. The Department of Homeless Services has relaxed intake procedures and intensified outreach efforts to connect vulnerable New Yorkers with shelter and warming centers.

#### Weather Forecast: A Deep Dive

The National Weather Service predicts substantial snowfall across the city, with rates of 1-2 inches per hour anticipated Sunday afternoon and evening. While a transition to sleet and freezing rain is possible Sunday evening, sub-freezing temperatures are expected to persist throughout the week, creating continuously hazardous conditions. Staten Island, in particular, has a 10% chance of seeing around 13 inches, a 90% probability of at least six inches on its North Shore (and four inches on the South Shore), and a 20-30% chance of 12 inches across the majority of the borough.

### Public Advisories and Safety Measures

In anticipation of the severe weather, Mayor Mamdani's administration has issued critical advisories, urging New Yorkers to exercise extreme caution. Residents are advised to allow ample travel time, prioritize public transportation, and utilize major streets if driving. Pedestrians should wear sturdy, waterproof boots and remain vigilant for slippery surfaces. A strong emphasis has been placed on fostering community support, with calls for New Yorkers to check on friends, relatives, and neighbors—especially older adults and those with disabilities—to ensure collective safety and well-being throughout the storm.

### Behind the Scenes / Background

The city’s preparations are meticulously planned and executed around the clock. NYC Emergency Management’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) will activate in person at 7 a.m. on Sunday, facilitating real-time coordination among city agencies, utilities, and transportation partners. The Department of Buildings is conducting random spot-check inspections of construction sites to ensure their security. DCAS's Fleet team is on call, while its Facilities, Maintenance, and Construction staff are deploying for snow removal and de-icing, prioritizing emergency hubs. The Department of Correction has activated its EOC and is providing shuttle bus service for Rikers Island staff. NYCHA is activating its virtual EOC and increasing staffing to minimize heat and hot water outages. Concurrently, HPD proactively reminded property owners about heat requirements and snow removal.

### Significance & What's Next

This potentially historic winter storm carries profound implications for daily life and public safety in New York City. The prolonged period of extreme cold and hazardous travel conditions will impact commuters, schools, and outdoor activities for several days. While high schools will function as warming centers on Monday, the broader decision regarding all NYC public schools for the day awaits Mayor Mamdani’s announcement on Sunday. Libraries across all three systems (New York, Brooklyn, and Queens) will be closed on Sunday, with Monday’s status yet to be determined. The city’s coordinated response underscores its resilience and commitment to public welfare during challenging weather events. The focus remains on navigating the immediate dangers and preparing for the persistent freezing temperatures throughout the week.

As New York City braces for this formidable winter storm, staying informed and prioritizing safety are paramount. Heed official advisories, prepare your homes, and check on your neighbors to help everyone navigate these challenging conditions safely. Stay tuned for Mayor Mamdani's forthcoming decision regarding NYC public schools for Monday.
