The ability to shuffle the board and rearrange the words offers an additional layer of strategy, enabling players to identify potential connections more easily.

The game's design encourages players to think creatively and consider multiple interpretations of the words.

The fact that players are allowed up to four mistakes adds a layer of forgiveness to the game, preventing frustration and encouraging continued engagement. This allows players to experiment with different combinations of words and learn from their errors, ultimately improving their problem-solving skills and deepening their understanding of the game's mechanics.
