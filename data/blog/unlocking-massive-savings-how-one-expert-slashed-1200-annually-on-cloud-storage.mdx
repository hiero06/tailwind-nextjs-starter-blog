## Unlocking Massive Savings: How One Expert Slashed $1200 Annually on Cloud Storage
\n
Are your cloud storage costs spiraling out of control, turning you into an unwitting data hoarder? David Gewirtz, a Senior Contributing Editor at ZDNET, found himself in this exact predicament, facing an ever-increasing bill for his vast digital archives. Discover how he implemented five strategic steps to dramatically cut his storage expenses, saving over $1,200 a year.
\n\n
### Event/Topic Overview: The Cloud Storage Reckoning
\n
For years, the promise of unlimited cloud storage was a digital dream, but by 2017, that dream evaporated, forcing users like David Gewirtz into a constant need for data migration. His substantial storage needs, fueled by networked virtual machines, 3D modeling, and high-quality video production, meant he was constantly seeking new solutions as vendors shut down their \"all-you-can-store\" plans.
\n
His journey ultimately led him to Google Workspace Enterprise, where his pursuit of unlimited storage evolved into an annual, demanding negotiation. By 2022, his two-person company faced a Google Workspace Enterprise plan that provided necessary access but at an increasingly steep and contested cost, culminating in a 38% fee hike that pushed him to a breaking point. This personal crisis sparked a complete re-evaluation of his entire data retention strategy.
\n

\n\n
### Key Highlights & Standouts: Five Steps to Savings
\n
David Gewirtz's overhaul involved tough decisions that redefined his backup architecture and significantly reduced his monthly outlay. These strategic shifts illustrate a practical path to reclaiming control over burgeoning cloud costs.
\n\n
#### Decision 1: Re-evaluating Older Media
\n
A crucial first step was recognizing that not all data requires cloud backup. Gewirtz decided to stop backing up large, archival-only datasets like old video production footage, imported DVD collections, and deprecated virtual machines to the cloud. While important locally, their catastrophic loss wouldn't impact day-to-day productivity, making cloud backup an unnecessary expense for these specific categories.
\n\n
#### Decision 2: Moving from Google Workspace Storage
\n
The constant, contentious negotiations with Google's storage gatekeepers reached their limit. Gewirtz made the tough but liberating choice to move off Google Workspace for cloud storage entirely, despite the \"sweet, sweet storage\" it once offered. This move was central to simplifying his cloud strategy and reducing costs.
\n\n
#### Decision 3: Ditching Time Machine
\n
Apple's canonical backup recommendation, Time Machine, was deemed unreliable and frustrating. Already syncing local Macs to iCloud and an on-premises backup server with ChronoSync, Gewirtz eliminated Time Machine. He transitioned to Backblaze Personal for individual machine backups, offering unlimited storage for a fixed fee per machine, a more stable and cost-effective alternative.
\n\n
#### Decision 4: Embracing Backblaze B2 for Server Storage
\n
For his critical file server documents, Gewirtz opted for Backblaze B2. This solution charges per terabyte, allowing him to maintain a solid, budget-friendly cloud backup by keeping his server's cloud storage needs under 4TB. He praised Backblaze's responsive support during his migration, highlighting a positive customer experience.
\n\n
#### Decision 5: Strategic Cloud Backup for Cost Control
\n
To keep Backblaze B2 costs down, Gewirtz forewent incremental backups for his file server's cloud storage. Instead, he utilized Backblaze B2's file retention feature, setting it to 10 days. This means he has a window to recover any accidentally deleted files, balancing security with significant cost savings without the continuous expense of incremental cloud archiving.
\n

\n\n
### Public & Critical Reaction
\n
While the article details a personal journey, it implicitly reflects broader industry shifts and user frustrations. The vanishing of \"unlimited\" cloud storage plans by various vendors forced countless users into similar \"data warehouse Whac-A-Mole\" scenarios, signaling a market-wide pivot away from unsustainable models. David Gewirtz's \"rocky, increasingly demanding, and increasingly more expensive\" relationship with Google Workspace for storage echoes a common sentiment among users who found their long-standing arrangements re-negotiated or terminated as providers tightened their offerings.
\n
His decision to ditch Time Machine, a standard Apple recommendation, also speaks to a segment of the tech community that finds alternative backup solutions more reliable or user-friendly. The positive experience with Backblaze support, in contrast to the \"constant debates with Google support,\" highlights the critical role customer service plays in user satisfaction and loyalty in the competitive cloud storage market.
\n\n
### Behind the Scenes / Background
\n
David Gewirtz's battle against escalating cloud costs began with a foundational \"3-2-1 backup strategy,\" advocating three copies of every file, two on different devices, and one off-site. For decades, this strategy involved physical hard drive shuttling, but his storage needs ballooned with intensive work in networked virtual machines, 3D modeling, and video production, leading to 139.04 terabytes of local storage across four at-home file servers.
\n
Before the migration, Gewirtz's setup was robust but intricate. Macs were backed up to a local server using Time Machine (which he disliked) and ChronoSync. His main file server, meanwhile, employed four distinct backup mechanisms: incremental backups and syncs to Google Workspace, a sync to a local backup server, and a weekly sync to a fire- and flood-proof offline backup server. All these systems implemented RAID for redundancy.
\n
This elaborate setup, while robust, was increasingly expensive, costing $162.50 per month for Google Workspace alone, plus additional fees for Gmail and iCloud storage.
\n\n
### Significance & What's Next
\n
David Gewirtz's strategic overhaul demonstrates a critical shift in personal and small business data management: moving from a \"hoard everything, pay whatever\" mentality to a meticulously optimized, cost-conscious approach. The significant $1,200 annual savings are a testament to the power of re-evaluating long-held practices and prioritizing truly mission-critical data for cloud backup.
\n
This new architecture, balancing local RAID servers, targeted cloud solutions like Backblaze B2 for essential documents, and Backblaze Personal for individual machines, provides a robust 3-2-1 strategy that is both secure and fiscally responsible. It sets a precedent for how individuals and small entities can navigate the evolving landscape of cloud storage. Gewirtz hopes this new approach brings \"a few years of smooth sailing,\" underscoring the ongoing need for vigilance and adaptability in digital data management. For readers, it offers a blueprint for their own cloud cost optimization journeys.
