## 2026 Winter Olympics Mass Start Speed Skating: Jordan Stolz and Ivanie Blondin Chase History in Milan-Cortina

As the Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Games approach their final full day of competition, the ice oval is poised for its most unpredictable and high-octane event: mass start speed skating. With elite athletes from Team USA and Team Canada ready to contend for the podium, Saturday's lineup promises a thrilling conclusion to the long-track program.

The men's and women's mass start events mark a significant departure from the traditional time-trial format, offering fans a pack-style race that emphasizes strategy, endurance, and physical positioning. As the world watches, superstars like Jordan Stolz and Ivanie Blondin aim to cement their legacies in what many consider the sport's most chaotic discipline.

### Event Overview: The Dynamics of the Mass Start

Mass start speed skating is a unique discipline where, rather than racing in pairs against the clock, more than a dozen athletes line up simultaneously to complete 16 laps around the 400m oval. This format introduces elements of drafting, tactical sprinting, and physical jostling—skills more commonly seen in short-track speed skating. For the Milan-Cortina Games, the competition is scheduled for Saturday, February 21, at the Olympic speed skating venue in Italy.

The competition commences with high-stakes semifinals. The men’s semifinals are slated to begin at 9:00 a.m. ET, followed by the women’s semifinals at 9:50 a.m. ET. In each gender category, two heats of 14 skaters will compete, with the top eight finishers from each heat advancing to the final medal rounds. The men's final is scheduled for 10:40 a.m. ET, with the women's final following shortly after at 11:15 a.m. ET. This demanding schedule ensures that only the most resilient skaters will have the energy left to sprint for gold in the closing laps.

### Key Highlights & Standouts

The final day of long-track skating features an impressive array of international talent, with several athletes coming off historic performances earlier in the week. From American phenoms to Canadian veterans, the narratives heading into the mass start are as compelling as the race itself.

#### Jordan Stolz’s Quest for a Third Olympic Gold

American sensation Jordan Stolz enters the men's mass start competition as the athlete to beat. At just 21 years old, Stolz has already captured gold medals in the 500m and 1,000m events in Milan, setting Olympic records along the way. Although he was narrowly defeated for gold in the 1,500m by China’s Ning Zhongyan, Stolz remains a dominant force in the sport. This mass start represents his fourth and final event of the 2026 Games, and a victory would further solidify his status as one of the greatest speed skaters in Olympic history. Having finished 13th and 14th in his previous Olympic appearances in Beijing at age 17, Stolz's remarkable transformation into a multi-gold medalist is the defining narrative of the U.S. speed skating team.

#### The Canadian Duo: Ivanie Blondin and Valérie Maltais

In women's mass start speed skating, Canada fields a formidable duo with Ivanie Blondin and Valérie Maltais. Blondin, a 35-year-old veteran and two-time mass start world champion, is aiming to upgrade the Olympic silver medal she won in 2022. She remains a top-tier contender, having secured World Cup gold in Calgary earlier this season. Her teammate, Valérie Maltais, enters the race with significant momentum after winning an unexpected bronze in the 1,500m on Friday. Maltais, a former short-track specialist, has successfully transitioned to the long track and has already collected a gold in the team pursuit and another bronze in the 3,000m during these Games. Her short-track background makes her uniquely suited for the tactical maneuvering required in a mass start final.

#### International Challengers and Dark Horses

The competition is far from a two-nation race. In the men's field, China's Ning Zhongyan poses a significant threat to Stolz, especially after his record-breaking performance in the 1,500m. Canada also fields Antoine Gélinas-Beaulieu, a 2024 world championship silver medalist who has consistently proven his ability to compete with the world's best. On the women's side, the Netherlands continues to be a powerhouse, led by Antoinette Rijpma-de Jong, who recently secured her first individual Olympic gold in the 1,500m. These athletes bring a mix of sprinting power and tactical experience that could easily disrupt the favorites in the final laps.

### Public & Critical Reaction

The mass start has quickly become a fan favorite due to its "unpredictable" and "chaotic" nature, as described by sports analysts. Fans have taken to social media to express excitement over the head-to-head format, which many find more spectator-friendly than traditional time-trial races. The buzz surrounding Jordan Stolz has garnered significant attention, with critics hailing him as the new face of American winter sports. His ability to maintain top speed across multiple distances has drawn comparisons to legendary skaters like Eric Heiden.

In Canada, the reaction to Valérie Maltais’ recent bronze medal has been one of surprise and widespread celebration. Critics noted that her best finish in the 1,500m at previous Games was a sixth-place result, achieved 12 years ago when she was primarily a short-track specialist. Her unexpected podium finish has fueled optimism that Canada could see a double-podium result in the mass start, given both Maltais's and Blondin's expertise in navigating crowded packs.

### Behind the Scenes / Background

The success of many of today's top mass start competitors can be traced back to their foundational training in short-track speed skating. Both Valérie Maltais and Ivanie Blondin began their careers on the smaller short-track oval, where they honed vital skills such as drafting, cornering in traffic, and timing a late-race kick. This background provides a significant strategic advantage in the mass start, where anticipating the movements of other skaters is just as crucial as raw speed.

For Jordan Stolz, the journey to the 2026 podium has been a study in rapid development. Since the Beijing 2022 Games, Stolz has focused on refining his technical efficiency, enabling him to dominate across various distances. His rigorous training regimen has transformed him into a versatile "all-arounder," a rarity in a sport often divided between pure sprinters and long-distance specialists. His final race in Milan is the culmination of four years of intense preparation aimed at becoming the most decorated skater of these Games.

### Significance & What's Next

The mass start events on Saturday carry immense weight for the overall medal table. For Norway and the Netherlands, these races are opportunities to maintain their traditional dominance on the ice. For the United States, a gold from Stolz would be a crowning achievement for a program that has seen a resurgence in recent years. For Canada, the mass start represents one of the final chances to enhance their medal tally on the last full day of the Games, contributing to what has already been a successful campaign for their skating and curling teams.

Following the conclusion of the speed skating events, the focus of the Winter Olympics will shift toward the closing ceremonies on Sunday. However, the impact of these performances will resonate throughout the next World Cup season. Younger skaters will look to the tactical blueprints laid out by veterans like Blondin and the sheer dominance of Stolz as they begin their own four-year cycle leading toward the next Winter Olympiad.

The results of these races will likely influence how national programs allocate resources, with a growing emphasis on "crossover" training between short-track and long-track disciplines to produce more competitive mass start athletes.

Whether anticipating the tactical mastery of the women's field or the historic speed of the men's competition, the mass start offers a perfect finale for the Milan-Cortina speed skating program. Witness the world's fastest athletes leave it all on the ice for Olympic glory.
