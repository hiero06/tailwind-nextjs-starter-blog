## Australia's Housing Paradox: Stable Employment and Surging Prices Defy Economic Gravity

Australia's economy currently presents a complex paradox, challenging policymakers and prospective homeowners alike. Despite aggressive interest rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation, the housing market remains fiercely competitive, fueled by a resilient labor market and a critically low unemployment rate. As mortgage sizes hit record highs and property values climb, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) signals that monetary policy alone cannot resolve the affordability crisis. This analysis explores the intersection of employment stability, surging mortgage debt, and the urgent demand for increased housing supply.

### Quick Context: The Housing Market Defies Gravity

To understand the current economic landscape, we must look beyond standard headline inflation figures and examine the behavior of consumers and lenders. The prevailing narrative suggests that rising interest rates should shrink borrowing capacity, theoretically leading to falling or stabilizing house prices. However, recent data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) paints a vastly different picture: one where average new mortgages are soaring, not shrinking.

This resilience is largely underpinned by the economy's robust health. While many analysts scrutinize job reports for signs of weakness, the labor market remains remarkably tight. This job security provides households with the confidence to take on larger debts, even as borrowing costs rise. Consequently, the property market is absorbing rate hikes and continuing to expand, fueled by a mix of first-time buyers, investors, and existing owners leveraging their equity.

#### Key Statistic: The $750,000 Threshold

In a striking market revelation, the average new Australian mortgage has climbed to nearly $750,000. This figure is not an outlier; it represents a new national baseline. In New South Wales (NSW), the situation is even more acute, with the average new mortgage hitting a record $873,000. Queensland has also seen dramatic movement, with average loans projected to soar by $101,000 through 2025, reaching $736,000. For the first time in history, the average mortgage taken out by homeowners now exceeds $500,000 in every single state and territory.

#### Surprising Fact: Investor Activity Hits Record Highs

Contrary to expectations that elevated interest rates would deter speculative buying, investors are flooding back into the market. In the final three months of last year alone, investors secured a record 60,445 loans. The total value of these mortgages jumped by almost a third over the past 12 months, reaching a staggering record of $43 billion. This suggests investors are banking on long-term capital growth and tight rental markets, outweighing the immediate costs of higher interest repayments.

### What You Need to Know: Analyzing the Data

The surge in loan sizes and market activity isn't limited to a single demographic; it's a broad-based phenomenon highlighting significant structural issues within the Australian property market. At its core, the issue stems from supply constraints colliding with stimulus-backed demand. While the persistent low unemployment rate ensures buyers have the income to qualify for loans, government incentives have also played a pivotal role in pushing loan sizes upward.

#### Core Development: First-Home Buyer Resilience

First-home buyers are demonstrating remarkable resilience. Approximately 32,000 first-time buyers secured a mortgage last quarter, marking the highest volume since early 2022 when cash rates were near zero (0.1 percent). The federal government’s decision to extend the 5 percent deposit scheme to all first-time buyers has proven to be a double-edged sword. While it has allowed more people to enter the market, it has also "fed the surge" in loan sizes, as buyers leverage these schemes to bid on increasingly expensive properties. JPMorgan economist Tom Ryan noted that the average mortgage for this demographic rose by 8.5 percent in just three months.

#### Core Development: The RBA's Supply-Side Stance

The Reserve Bank has unequivocally stated that interest rates are a blunt instrument for controlling asset prices. RBA Deputy Governor Andrew Hauser pushed back against the notion that rates are the primary driver of current price movements. Instead, he emphasized a fundamental physical deficit: Australia "needs to build a lot more houses." While Australia constructs a significant number of homes by international standards, this volume remains insufficient to meet the demand generated by population growth and a robust economy. Hauser’s comments suggest that without a substantial supply-side response, monetary policy can only do so much to contain housing costs.

### Why This Matters: The Unemployment Rate Connection

The interplay between the housing market and the labor market is critical. The primary reason the property market hasn't collapsed under the weight of higher interest rates is the persistently low unemployment rate. When people have jobs, they can pay their mortgages. When they feel secure in their employment, they are more willing to take on new debt. This economic "animal spirit" fuels market activity, but it also complicates the RBA's efforts to combat inflation.

Should the job report show a sudden spike in unemployment, the market dynamics would shift rapidly. Forced sales would increase, and borrowing capacity would diminish. However, as long as the labor market remains robust, housing demand is likely to persist. This creates a challenging environment for the RBA: they must cool the economy to bring down inflation, yet the wealth effect from rising house prices—supported by high employment—keeps consumer spending stronger than anticipated.

Furthermore, the data reveals a disparity in how monetary policy impacts various regions. Victoria and the ACT, leading the nation in new housing approvals, saw the smallest increases in mortgage sizes (6.6 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively). This validates the RBA’s argument that supply is the ultimate moderator of prices. Where homes are being built, price growth is more contained.

### What Experts Are Saying

Prominent figures in Australia’s economic landscape offer varying perspectives on the market’s future trajectory. Their insights offer a glimpse into how the interplay between fiscal policy, monetary policy, and market sentiment is expected to evolve.

**Andrew Hauser, RBA Deputy Governor:** Hauser remains focused on the "real" economy. He noted that the Australian economy is performing "reasonably well," citing the low unemployment rate and growth in private sector capital spending. However, he stressed the need to "relaunch these animal spirits" to boost productivity. His comments signal that the RBA is willing to "do whatever is necessary" to tame inflation, implying that further rate hikes remain a possibility if productivity does not improve.

**Matt Comyn, CEO of Commonwealth Bank:** As the head of the nation's largest home lender, Comyn’s outlook is influential. He anticipates potentially one more rate rise this year but believes it will have a "limited effect" on the property market. He acknowledges that households are stretched but predicts the period of hikes will be "relatively brief." His bank's $5.4 billion half-year profit underscores the banking sector's resilience amid the lending boom.

**Jenny Wilkinson, Treasury Secretary:** Wilkinson addressed the political dimensions of the crisis. Responding to claims that government spending drove the rate hikes, she clarified that actual government spending was lower than expected. Instead, she pointed to a "surprise lift in business spending" and "stronger household expenditure"—both byproducts of a healthy labor market—as key drivers of inflation. She reinforced that the underlying stance of fiscal policy has not changed.

### Potential Impact & Future Outlook

Looking ahead, the tension between curbing inflation and housing the population will likely dominate the economic narrative. Job reports and unemployment data will continue to be the most closely watched metrics. If unemployment remains low, the floor supporting the housing market will remain solid, regardless of minor interest rate fluctuations.

In the short term, the "super-sized" mortgage trend is expected to continue. With investors capturing a larger market share ($43 billion in loans) and first-home buyers utilizing deposit schemes to maximize their borrowing capacity, prices in supply-constrained areas like Sydney and Brisbane will likely test new highs. The RBA’s signaled rate hikes may dampen sentiment slightly, but as Matt Comyn suggests, the impact may be negligible if buyers perceive rates to be near their peak.

In the long term, the solution rests entirely on supply. The RBA’s call to "build a lot more houses" is a clear directive to state and federal governments to streamline approvals and incentivize construction. Without a significant uptick in housing stock, the gap between wages and property prices will widen, potentially creating a generation of renters locked out of ownership despite stable employment. The focus must shift from demand-side stimulus (such as deposit schemes) to supply-side reform to restore market balance.

### Conclusion

The Australian property market is currently rewriting the rulebook, proving that elevated interest rates alone are insufficient to curb demand when the unemployment rate is low and confidence is high. While this resilience speaks to the broader economy's strength, it poses significant risks for affordability and inflation control. As the RBA navigates this delicate balance, the clear takeaway for prospective buyers and policymakers is that while the era of cheap credit may be over, the era of high demand is far from finished. To stay ahead of these trends, continuous monitoring of labor market data and housing supply approvals is essential.
