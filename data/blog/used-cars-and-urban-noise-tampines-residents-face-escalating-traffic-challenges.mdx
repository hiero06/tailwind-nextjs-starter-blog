## Used Cars and Urban Noise: Tampines Residents Face Escalating Traffic Challenges

The persistent roar of engines and the screech of tires have become an unwelcome soundtrack for many residents in Singapore’s eastern heartlands. As the city-state continues to expand its transport infrastructure, the intersection of high-performance used cars, modified motorcycles, and residential tranquility has reached a critical point in Tampines.

Residents living near the Tampines Expressway (TPE) report being abruptly awakened in the early hours, describing the experience as both jarring and physically distressing. This growing conflict between vehicular activity and urban living has now reached the halls of Parliament, highlighting a significant shift in how Singaporeans perceive the noise generated by vehicles close to their homes.

### Overview of the Issue

At the heart of the problem are residential blocks in Tampines Street 34, specifically Blocks 366 and 368, which directly overlook the newly completed TPE flyover towards Changi East. Since the flyover's completion in 2023, traffic noise has escalated from a tolerable hum to an "ear-splitting" nuisance. The situation is further compounded by ongoing construction near the Loyang Viaduct and a newly opened slip road towards Tampines Avenue 7, which began operating in September 2025.

Tampines GRC Member of Parliament (MP) Charlene Chen recently raised these pressing concerns in Parliament, advocating for immediate mitigation measures to safeguard the health and well-being of her constituents. The Ministry of Transport has acknowledged the issue, noting that islandwide satisfaction with noise levels has declined, falling from 75.7 percent in 2018 to 74 percent in 2025. This downturn is largely attributed to external environmental factors, with traffic emerging as a primary contributor.

### Key Impacts and Resident Stories

The daily struggles of Tampines residents paint a vivid picture of how high-decibel traffic can profoundly affect a community. From disrupted sleep to families contemplating relocation, the narratives emerging from Tampines underscore a growing urban crisis.

#### The "World-Breaking" Sound of Revving Engines

Abdul Razak Subahan, a 65-year-old software developer residing at Block 366 Tampines Street 34, has become a prominent advocate for noise reduction. He describes being frequently jolted awake by the incessant revving of used cars and motorcycles along the road. "It can be very painful," he noted, characterizing the sensation as a sudden shock to the system. The abrupt "zoom" of a passing vehicle at night is, in his words, "as if the world is breaking."

#### Impact on the Next Generation

The noise is not merely a nuisance for adults; it is actively impeding the development of children in the area. Sales manager Jonathan Wong, 42, shared that the "vrooming" sounds, which intensify after 2 am on weekends, leave his primary school-going children perpetually exhausted. He conveyed the frustration of having to send his children to school with "sleepy eyes" due to insufficient rest, rendering existing mitigation measures seemingly ineffective against speeding vehicles.

#### The "Triple Whammy" of Infrastructure

Residents like 70-year-old retiree Francis Cheng fear the situation will only worsen. With two flyovers already operational and the Loyang Viaduct slated for completion in two years, the community is bracing for what they term a "triple whammy." This cumulative effect of multiple elevated roads is expected to amplify noise levels even further, prompting some neighbors to give up entirely and seek solace in quieter districts.

### Public and Critical Reaction

Public sentiment in Tampines is characterized by deep frustration and exhaustion. While infrastructure projects are often perceived as markers of progress, for these residents, they symbolize a decline in their quality of life. The latest HDB Sample Household Survey reflects this sentiment, indicating a clear downward trend in satisfaction regarding environmental noise.

MP Charlene Chen has actively channeled this frustration into political action. She has urged the Ministry of Transport to expedite the implementation of noise-reducing road surfaces and to conduct more rigorous post-completion monitoring. The feedback from the ground suggests that while residents understand the necessity of new roads, they believe current safeguards for residential health—especially concerning sleep and children’s learning environments—are inadequate.

Online and within the community, there is also a vocal call for stricter enforcement against modified used cars and motorcycles. Many residents believe that the most disturbing noises originate not from standard traffic but from vehicles intentionally altered to produce greater sound, leading to demands for more frequent late-night enforcement operations.

### Behind the Scenes: Government Response

The government's response involves a combination of engineering solutions and law enforcement. Minister of State for Transport Baey Yam Keng has detailed several measures currently being implemented or planned. These include the erection of permanent noise barriers along sections of the Loyang Viaduct that face residential blocks. Furthermore, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is deploying a "low-noise pavement mix" designed to absorb sound more effectively than traditional asphalt.

Concurrently, enforcement efforts are intensifying. An overnight operation on January 16, involving the LTA, the National Environment Agency, and the Traffic Police, resulted in several motorbikes being flagged for emitting illegal noise levels. While these operations offer some immediate relief, MP Charlene Chen has noted that enforcement alone is a reactive measure. The broader objective is to find ways to deter noise pollution "upstream" before it impacts residential areas.

### Significance and Future Outlook

The situation in Tampines serves as a compelling case study for urban planning in high-density cities. It underscores the delicate balance required between enhancing transport connectivity and preserving the sanctity of the home. As Singapore continues to develop its road network to support a growing population and economy, the "Tampines experience" will likely shape future policies regarding noise barriers and road surfacing technologies.

Looking ahead, the completion of the Loyang Viaduct in approximately two years will be a significant milestone. Residents will closely observe whether the promised permanent noise barriers and specialized road surfaces will be sufficient to restore the "peace and quiet" they have been longing for. For the used car market and vehicle enthusiasts, this also signals a period of heightened scrutiny, as enforcement agencies intensify efforts to curb noise-related modifications to meet community demands for a quieter environment.

The ongoing dialogue among residents, their MP, and the Ministry of Transport suggests that noise mitigation is no longer an afterthought in infrastructure development but a crucial component of residential satisfaction in modern Singapore.

The struggle for quiet in Tampines vividly illustrates the complex interplay between urban growth and personal well-being. As authorities work to implement noise-reducing technologies and enforce stricter standards on vehicle modifications, the hope is that residents can finally find respite. Stay informed on the latest urban developments and community news to see how these changes will impact the future of Singaporean living.
