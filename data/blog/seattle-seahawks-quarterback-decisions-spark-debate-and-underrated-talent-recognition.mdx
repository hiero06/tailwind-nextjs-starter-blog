## Seattle Seahawks' Quarterback Decisions Spark Debate and Underrated Talent Recognition

The Seattle Seahawks' quarterback situation is under scrutiny as they place their confidence in veteran Sam Darnold, potentially overshadowing other valuable players. Meanwhile, former Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith is being recognized for his contributions and skills, adding intrigue to the team's evolving dynamics.

### Event/Topic Overview

The Seattle Seahawks are navigating a quarterback transition, entrusting the offense to Sam Darnold while trading away former starter Geno Smith. This decision has sparked debate, especially given Smith's proven track record and the emergence of rookie Jalen Milroe. The Chiefs and Seahawks face off in preseason week 2 where the Seahawks starters will play.

### Key Highlights & Standouts

The Seahawks' quarterback decisions and player performances have created several noteworthy highlights, both on and off the field.

#### Geno Smith's Underrated Status

Despite being traded to the Las Vegas Raiders, Geno Smith is being recognized as one of the NFL's most underrated quarterbacks. Smith's impressive stats during his tenure with the Seahawks, including leading the league in completion percentage in 2022 and orchestrating multiple game-winning drives, highlight his value. Sportsnaut notes his high on-target rate and low bad throw rate, suggesting he could thrive with better pass protection in Las Vegas.

#### Sam Darnold's Opportunity

Sam Darnold is stepping into the starting quarterback role for the Seahawks, presenting him with a chance to prove his capabilities. While the Seahawks are hopeful Darnold will perform at a high level, the pressure is on to justify the decision to move on from Smith.

#### Rookie Performances and Training Camp Standouts

Rookie safety Nick Emmanwori has been turning heads at training camp, although a minor setback hampered his preseason debut. Meanwhile, the Chiefs' punter Matt Araiza stood out in their first preseason game. Pro Football Network even named him the best player for the Chiefs in Week 1 of the preseason. In five punts, he totaled 285 yards, averaging 57 yards per punt, with a long of 68 yards and placing two punts inside the 20-yard line. Matt Araiza was the punter for the team last season, and he had a good season. Now he is looking to get better in 2025 and what he showed in the first preseason game was that he was in mid-season form.

#### Defensive Players to Watch

As the Seahawks prepare for their second preseason game, several defensive players are under the spotlight. Safety Nick Emmanwori, cornerback Nehemiah Pritchett, and defensive tackle Byron Murphy II are players to watch. Pritchett, now a sophomore cornerback, is pushing for a reserve role after displaying growth at training camp this year. Murphy's rookie season was hampered by injury, hopefully versus the Chiefs, he will showcase significant improvement this season. Reserve linebacker Drake Thomas should also play extensively against the Chiefs.

### Public & Critical Reaction

The Seahawks' quarterback decision has drawn mixed reactions, with some questioning the trade of Geno Smith and the reliance on Sam Darnold. Smith's recognition as an underrated quarterback has further fueled the debate. Meanwhile, the praise for Chiefs punter Matt Araiza highlights the impact of special teams performances.

### Behind the Scenes / Background

Pete Carroll's move to the Las Vegas Raiders and his desire to bring Geno Smith along underscores the value he places on Smith's abilities. The Seahawks' acquisition of Jalen Milroe in exchange for Smith adds another layer to the quarterback dynamic, showcasing their long-term vision.

### Significance & What's Next

The Seahawks' quarterback situation has significant implications for their upcoming season. The success of Sam Darnold will determine whether the decision to trade Geno Smith was justified. Smith's performance with the Raiders will also be closely watched, adding a compelling narrative to the season.

Looking ahead, the performance of rookies like Jalen Milroe and Nick Emmanwori will shape the Seahawks' future. The development of players like Nehemiah Pritchett and Byron Murphy II will be crucial for the team's defensive capabilities.

The quarterback decisions, the recognition of underrated talents, and the emergence of promising rookies set the stage for an intriguing NFL season.
