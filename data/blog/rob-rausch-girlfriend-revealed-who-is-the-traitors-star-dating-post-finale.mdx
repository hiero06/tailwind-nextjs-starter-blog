## Rob Rausch Girlfriend Revealed: Who Is The Traitors Star Dating Post-Finale?

Peacock's Rob Rausch, a standout from *The Traitors*, has finally answered the question on every fan's mind: who is the former *Love Island* heartthrob dating? During the highly anticipated reunion of *The Traitors* Season 4, the reptile wrangler confirmed his relationship status, putting an end to months of intense speculation about his romantic life.

The 27-year-old reality star, who gained significant recognition across multiple seasons of *Love Island USA* before dominating the competition in the Scottish Highlands, has officially confirmed he is off the market. While his time in the castle was marked by strategic gameplay and a heavy dose of flirtation, Rausch used the reunion stage to announce that his heart has been claimed by a new mystery woman, much to the surprise of "America's heartthrob" enthusiasts.

### Event Overview: The Traitors Season 4 Reunion Reveal

The reveal unfolded during the dramatic reunion special for Season 4 of *The Traitors*, which aired immediately following the high-stakes finale. Host Andy Cohen wasted no time getting straight to the point, directly asking Rausch about his current relationship status. Rausch, known for his laid-back demeanor and dry wit, confirmed that he is no longer single and has been in a relationship for approximately two months.

This news follows Rausch’s solo victory on the hit series, where he skillfully outmaneuvered his fellow contestants to claim the entire $220,800 prize. In the finale, Rausch successfully convinced his closest ally in the game, Maura Higgins, that he was a "Faithful," only to reveal himself as a "Traitor" at the very last moment, securing the life-changing sum for himself. The reunion marked the first public reconciliation among the cast following the dramatic betrayal in the finale.

### Key Highlights &amp; Standouts

Post-show discussions have largely revolved around the intersection of Rob’s strategic triumph and his evolving personal life. From the Birkin bag drama to his new relationship, several key moments have kept the public captivated.

#### The Official Relationship Confirmation

When Andy Cohen highlighted that Rausch had "locked it down" just as he became a national obsession, Rob jokingly responded, "Just my luck." Despite the playful comment, Rausch confirmed he has been dating his new girlfriend for two months, though he has kept her identity private for the time being. This confirmation put an end to the dating rumors that had been linking him and co-star Maura Higgins since their time in Ardross Castle.

#### The $220,800 Betrayal and the Birkin Promise

One of the most talked-about highlights of the season was Rob’s bold move against Maura Higgins. After tricking her into trusting him at the "Fire of Truth," Rob walked away with the full prize. To make amends, Rob shared at the reunion that he plans to spend a portion of his winnings on a luxury gift for Higgins. "I said to him, ‘I will accept nothing less than a Birkin handbag,’" Higgins recounted, emphasizing that she deserves the gift because Rausch "wouldn't have won without me."

#### Lisa Rinna’s "Iconic" Support

In a surprising development, *Real Housewives* alum and fellow *Traitors* contestant Lisa Rinna has emerged as one of Rob’s most prominent public supporters. Following the finale, Rinna was seen in New York City dressed in Rob’s signature look—denim overalls and a white tank top. Rinna has also stepped in to assist Rob in navigating the exclusive world of Hermès. Rob confirmed he is "in cahoots" with Rinna to secure the Birkin for Maura, as these coveted bags often require a personal relationship with a sales associate for purchase. Rob admitted the process is "proving way more difficult than I thought it would be."

### Public &amp; Critical Reaction

The public reaction to Rob Rausch’s new relationship has been a mix of disappointment from devoted fans and widespread celebration for his success. Andy Cohen’s labeling of Rausch as "America’s heartthrob" resonated across social media, where fans have closely followed his transition from the beaches of *Love Island* to the strategic depth of *The Traitors*. Many viewers lauded his "incredible game" while noting the irony of him finding love just as his popularity soared.

Maura Higgins has also been open about her reaction to Rob’s gameplay. Despite the betrayal, she told *Us Weekly* that she isn't taking his role as a Traitor "to heart," explaining that since he was chosen for the role, he was simply playing the game he was assigned. However, she was candid about her "severe trust issues," revealing that she has been celibate for a year following past relationships where she was cheated on. This personal revelation added a layer of depth to her friendship with Rob, clarifying that there was never a real-life romance between them.

### Behind the Scenes / Background

Rob Rausch’s journey to *The Traitors* was shaped by his recurring appearances on *Love Island USA*. Having appeared in both Season 5 (2023) and Season 6 (2024), Rausch was no stranger to the spotlight. However, he admitted to *GQ* that he repeatedly considered walking away from the reality TV circuit. The "reptile wrangler" from Alabama often struggled with the pressures of the industry, at one point telling *The Cut* that a big part of him "just wants to f— off."

Despite his reservations, the financial incentives and the thrill of competition kept him returning. Rob noted that it is difficult to refuse opportunities that could "set up your kids for college" a decade down the road. Behind the scenes, the bond between the Season 4 cast appears strong, with the reunion highlighting how the players balance the "fake" betrayals of the game with their real-life friendships and burgeoning romantic endeavors.

### Significance &amp; What's Next

Rob Rausch’s win and subsequent relationship reveal mark a significant turning point in his career. By winning *The Traitors*, he has moved beyond the "heartthrob" archetype of dating shows and established himself as a formidable strategic competitor in the reality TV landscape. His ability to maintain a positive public image despite a "villainous" game-winning move is a testament to his charisma and the evolving audience appreciation for high-level gameplay.

As for what’s next, Rausch hasn't ruled out a return to the screen. While he expressed a desire for privacy regarding his new girlfriend, he hinted that he would "probably do another competition show" in the future. Meanwhile, the quest for the Birkin bag continues, with Lisa Rinna serving as his mentor in the world of high fashion. Fans are eagerly waiting to see if Rob can successfully "get his foot in the door" at Hermès and if his new relationship will thrive under the continued glare of the public eye.

The ongoing narrative of Rob Rausch continues to demonstrate that in the world of reality television, the most unexpected moves—both in the game and in personal life—are often the ones that leave the most lasting impact.

Whether you were rooting for a Maura and Rob romance or you’re just here for the Birkin bag drama, there’s no denying that Rob Rausch is currently the man of the hour. Catch up on the full season of *The Traitors* to see how the "reptile wrangler" slithered his way to the top, and follow his post-show journey as he navigates a new relationship and the complexities of high-end fashion.
