## Nasdaq Sell-Off Intensifies: Tech Stocks Plunge Amid AI Capital Expenditure Shock and Rotation to Value

The tech-heavy **Nasdaq** index faced significant selling pressure today, dragging the broader **stock market** lower in what analysts characterized as a pronounced, tech-driven decline. Investors are urgently asking **why the market is down today**, as disappointing forecasts from major semiconductor players collided with a massive capital expenditure projection from Alphabet, sparking extreme volatility in high-growth **stocks**.

### Quick Context: A Deep Tech-Led Sell-off

February 5, 2026, was a challenging day for growth-oriented sectors, leading to significant underperformance for major US indices, particularly those heavily weighted toward technology. While the Dow 30 managed to outperform, bolstered by strength in value and defensive names, the **Nasdaq 100** (NDX)—often tracked by investors through the **QQQ stock**—bore the brunt of the volatility.

The divergence between the indices signaled a clear rotation in market preference. While the Dow gained slightly, the **S&P 500** (US500) saw a substantial drop, and the Nasdaq 100 experienced an even steeper correction. This movement highlighted persistent risk-off sentiment targeting high valuations within the technology ecosystem.

#### Key Statistic: Nasdaq 100 Decline

The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 registered a sharp decline of 1.8% to 24,891, demonstrating a severely dampened appetite for high-flying tech names. The broader S&P 500 followed suit, sliding approximately 1.02%.

#### Surprising Fact: Dow Outperformance

In stark contrast to the tech sell-off, the Dow 30 managed to post a positive gain of 0.5%. This was primarily supported by strength in value and defensive stocks like Amgen, which jumped over 8% following a strong earnings beat, suggesting a flight to safety within the equity markets.

### What You Need to Know: Drivers Behind the Selling Pressure

The rapid decline in **Nasdaq stocks** can be attributed to a confluence of company-specific earnings disappointments, sector-wide valuation concerns, and macroeconomic uncertainty regarding interest rate paths and employment data.

#### Core Development: The AI CapEx Paradox

While artificial intelligence remains the central growth narrative, Alphabet’s earnings report created substantial volatility. The company projected a sharp increase in 2026 AI spending, estimating capital expenditures between $175 billion and $185 billion for AI-focused data centers. Although this signals long-term commitment, the massive upfront cost shocked the market, leading to a 2.2% decline by the close, despite the company beating revenue and earnings expectations.

#### Semiconductor Stocks Take a Major Hit

The semiconductor sector, crucial to the **Nasdaq**’s health, faced immense pressure. Shares of Nvidia (-3.4%), Broadcom (-3.8%), and especially AMD (-17.3% by the close) weighed heavily on sentiment. AMD’s dramatic decline, stemming from revised outlooks and broader constraints, served as a potent example of how quickly sentiment can turn negative when growth expectations are challenged.

#### Weak Guidance and Market Disappointment

Beyond the semiconductor giants, several other key technology companies issued disappointing forecasts that fueled the bearish outlook. Qualcomm shares plummeted 9.7% after hours following a weaker-than-expected forecast, citing memory constraints. Similarly, Uber slid 5.1% after beating earnings but disappointing investors with cautious near-term guidance. The continuous stream of negative forecasts confirms a difficult listing environment, as evidenced by the €19bn Visma software offering considering a delay into the latter half of 2026 due to the broad sell-off in the sector.

#### The Crypto and Risk Asset Contagion

The "risk-off" mood was not confined to equities. The crypto sphere saw mounting losses, with Bitcoin breaking below the $71K mark and Ether falling below $2.1K. This liquidity pressure and generalized risk aversion directly impacted publicly traded crypto **stocks**, with Coinbase (-6.1%) and Riot Platforms (-7.8%) tracking digital assets lower, adding to the overall bearish tone of the market.

### Why This Matters (Implications)

The sharp pullback in the **Nasdaq** and the **S&P 500** signals that investors are prioritizing profitability and capital discipline over aggressive growth spending, even when focused on game-changing technology like AI. This rotation fundamentally alters the market landscape, pushing money toward defensives and sectors outside of pure technology.

For average investors, understanding **why stocks are down today** means recognizing that market leadership is shifting. If tech giants continue to promise massive investment without immediate returns, the volatility experienced by the **QQQ stock** is likely to persist. Furthermore, the market remains highly sensitive to macroeconomic indicators. The weaker-than-expected US ADP private payrolls report (22K vs 46K forecast) added to uncertainty, while hawkish Fed talk helped push the US Dollar Index higher, further pressuring risk assets.

This market condition also influences corporate decisions. The consideration by Visma, the €19bn private equity-backed software group, to push back London’s largest IPO in years due to the broad software sell-off confirms that public market conditions are unfavorable for highly valued growth listings, suggesting caution is spreading from trading desks to corporate boardrooms.

### What Experts Are Saying

Market sentiment data captured by platforms like Capital.com reflects the hesitation among investors to buy the dip during the **Nasdaq** decline. Despite the sharp pullback, long bias dropped slightly in the **S&P 500**, while holding firm but not increasing aggressively in the Nasdaq, indicating that many trend traders are remaining on the sidelines. The overall outlook suggested downside risk was building as the tech segment struggled to reclaim lost ground.

Further analysis highlighted growing vulnerability in stock positioning, particularly as traders attempted to process the conflicting signals of long-term AI opportunity versus short-term profit pressure. The focus remains on stability, with the Dow Jones drawing flows away from the historically high-flying tech components of the **Nasdaq**. For those trading specific tech components, the high volatility around earnings, such as Super Micro Computer (SMCI) jumping 14% on an easy beat, shows stock-picking risks are extreme.

### Potential Impact & Future Outlook

The immediate future for the **Nasdaq** hinges on macro events and institutional flows. With the Bank of England (BoE) and European Central Bank (ECB) monetary policy announcements expected to result in rate holds, global liquidity conditions may remain tight, sustaining the current risk-off tone.

The long-term outlook, however, presents a bifurcated path. While near-term volatility, driven by technical selling and macroeconomic uncertainty, is likely to continue challenging high-valuation tech **stocks**, the underlying trend of massive investment in AI infrastructure (as exemplified by Alphabet’s substantial CAPEX forecast) provides a fundamental floor for the technology sector. This suggests that while individual stock performance will remain erratic, the Nasdaq’s structural growth potential remains intact, provided investors can weather the short-term earnings constraints and rate fears.

A key focus for the coming days will be US jobs data, particularly given the delay of the Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report to February 11. Until that key economic indicator provides clarity on the employment component of the Fed’s dual mandate, investors may continue to favor rotational strategies, leading to further pressure on the **Nasdaq** while benefiting value sectors within the **S&P 500**.

Navigating this complex environment requires robust data and insight. As the market digests massive AI capital expenditures against disappointing forecasts, caution remains paramount. Before making investment decisions, always remember the high risks associated with trading financial instruments and cryptocurrencies.

### Conclusion

The recent tech-led sell-off clearly illustrates the market's sensitivity to high-cost growth strategies and shifting sentiment away from speculative assets. The sharp decline in the **Nasdaq**, alongside broader losses in the **S&P 500**, confirms that rotational dynamics are currently dominating the **stock market**, favoring value and defensive names over high-growth technology. To navigate this uncertain period and stay informed on the latest movements in the **stock market news**, ensure you perform your own due diligence and remain updated on upcoming central bank decisions and economic reports.
