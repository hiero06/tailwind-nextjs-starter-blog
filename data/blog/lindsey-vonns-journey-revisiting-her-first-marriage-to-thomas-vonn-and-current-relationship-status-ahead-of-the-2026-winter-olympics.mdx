## Lindsey Vonn's Journey: Revisiting Her First Marriage to Thomas Vonn and Current Relationship Status Ahead of the 2026 Winter Olympics

Olympic legend Lindsey Vonn is once again demonstrating her enduring spirit, training rigorously for the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics despite a severe knee injury. As the "Queen of Speed" sets her sights on making history, renewed public interest has emerged regarding her personal life, particularly her past marriage to fellow Olympian **Thomas Vonn**. Fans are eager to know: **is Lindsey Vonn married** now, or is her focus purely on the podium?

### Event/Topic Overview

At 41 years old, Lindsey Vonn is attempting a historic comeback at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina, aiming to add another medal to her collection. Her return is marked by immense physical challenges, as she competes with a titanium knee and a torn ACL in the opposite knee, demonstrating an unparalleled commitment to her sport.

### Key Highlights & Standouts

#### The Marriage to Thomas Vonn

Vonn’s dating history frequently draws headlines, but her first significant relationship in the skiing world was her marriage to **Thomas Vonn**. The couple married in 2007, intertwining their professional lives as Thomas also served as her coach during this period. Their marriage concluded with a divorce in 2013, marking a significant personal and professional transition for the alpine star.

#### Recent Relationship Status: Is Lindsey Vonn Married?

As of early 2026, **Lindsey Vonn** is currently single. Following her highly publicized three-year relationship with golf icon Tiger Woods (2013–2015) and her subsequent engagement to NHL star P.K. Subban (which ended in 2020), Vonn was most recently linked to Spanish entrepreneur Diego Osorio.

However, Vonn confirmed her split from Osorio in February 2025. Since then, she has not been linked to any new partners, emphasizing her dedication to training for the 2026 Games. The answer to "is Lindsey Vonn married?" is definitively no; she is currently embracing independence while pursuing her athletic goals.

#### Defiant Training Amidst Injury

Vonn has completed two training runs ahead of the Olympic women's downhill, even while wearing a knee brace for her ACL tear. Her unwavering resolve, despite her knee being "100 percent" gone, underscores her status as one of the most tenacious athletes in Olympic history.

### Behind the Scenes / Background

Lindsey Vonn has stated that her renewed focus on elite competition, particularly since her split from Diego Osorio, has demanded her full attention. While she acknowledges the path can feel lonely, she remains deeply fulfilled by the challenge. Her recent appearances on the World Cup circuit and training sessions have featured her coaching team—including her close friend and coach Aksel Lund Svindal—rather than a romantic partner.

### Significance & What's Next

For Lindsey Vonn, the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics represent a chance to secure an unprecedented record. Should she win a medal, she will become the oldest female alpine skier ever to achieve this distinction. Her current priorities are clear: focusing entirely on her performance on the downhill course in Italy, aiming to cement her already stellar legacy.

Despite the constant scrutiny of her personal life and the history-making pressure she faces, Lindsey Vonn’s priorities remain fixed on the demanding slopes of the 2026 Winter Games. Though her marriage to **Thomas Vonn** ended years ago, her competitive spirit endures. Follow her journey as she attempts one of the most remarkable comebacks in Olympic history.
