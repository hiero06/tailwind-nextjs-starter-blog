## Critics Choice Awards 2026: Timothée Chalamet's Viral Confession, Michael B. Jordan's Deadpan Stare, and 'Jay Kelly' Create Buzz

The 31st annual Critics Choice Awards delivered an unforgettable night, sweeping through Hollywood with a blend of anticipated triumphs and surprising viral sensations. From heartfelt acceptance speeches to unexpected celebrity reactions, the ceremony not only celebrated the best in film and television but also sparked widespread social media discussions.

### Event Overview: The 2026 Critics Choice Awards Spectacle

Held at Santa Monica's Barker Hangar, the 31st Critics Choice Awards gathered a galaxy of stars to celebrate cinematic and television excellence. Comedian Chelsea Handler returned to host for her fourth consecutive year, expertly steering the three-hour star-studded event with her characteristic wit and engaging stage presence. The awards are widely regarded as a significant barometer for future Oscar successes, often providing early insights into the films and performances poised for major industry honors.

This year also saw an expansion of categories, with the Critics Choice Association introducing four new awards: Best Casting/Ensemble, Best Variety Series, Stunt Design, and Sound. This expansion further broadened the scope of recognition across the creative arts.

### Key Highlights & Standouts

The 2026 Critics Choice Awards were filled with memorable performances and viral highlights that captured the attention of audiences and critics alike, setting social media ablaze.

#### Timothée Chalamet's Public Declaration of Love

One of the night's most talked-about moments was Timothée Chalamet's Best Actor win for his role in "Marty Supreme." During his emotional acceptance speech, Chalamet publicly thanked his girlfriend, Kylie Jenner, revealing they had been together for "three years" and crediting her for building their "foundation." Jenner, visibly moved, mouthed "I love you" from the audience, creating a rare and widely discussed public display of affection from the typically private couple.

#### Michael B. Jordan's Unimpressed Reaction

As Chalamet delivered his emotional speech, cameras famously lingered on Michael B. Jordan, also nominated for Best Actor for "Sinners." Jordan's stone-faced, seemingly bored expression quickly became an internet sensation, offering a stark, hilarious contrast to Chalamet's emotional outpouring and sparking countless memes across social platforms.

#### Adam Sandler's "Jay Kelly" Nomination

Among the stellar nominees for Best Supporting Actor was Adam Sandler for his work in the Netflix film "Jay Kelly." While Paul Mescal ultimately took home the award for "Hamnet," Sandler's nomination highlighted another strong performance in a competitive category, thus elevating "Jay Kelly" into the awards season spotlight.

#### Teyana Taylor's "Hype Woman" Energy

Teyana Taylor was dubbed the "hype woman of the year" for her unbridled enthusiasm throughout the evening. Her unrestrained joy was particularly evident when Paul Thomas Anderson won Best Director for "One Battle After Another." Taylor leaped to her feet, embracing Anderson with fervent enthusiasm, and later shouted "Let's go!" as she joined her co-stars on stage for their film's Best Picture win, amusing both castmates and viewers.

#### Kathy Bates' Cheeky Tribute to Chalamet

Veteran actress Kathy Bates provided a moment of unadulterated comedic brilliance with a hilariously cheeky tribute to Timothée Chalamet. After host Chelsea Handler joked about Chalamet not needing a "butt double" for certain scenes in "Marty Supreme" and announced a ping pong paddle as a prize for an audience member, Bates was revealed as the winner. Her seductive lick of the paddle sent the audience into fits of laughter, a self-deprecating stunt that instantly went viral.

#### Owen Cooper's Historic Win for "Adolescence"

Sixteen-year-old Owen Cooper made history by becoming the youngest-ever recipient of the Best Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie Made for Television award for his role in Netflix's "Adolescence." His heartfelt acceptance speech reflected on a "whirlwind" year that "changed our lives forever," underscoring the emergence of significant new talent in the television landscape.

#### KPop Demon Hunters' Double Victory

Netflix's animated hit, "KPop Demon Hunters," cemented its status as a cultural phenomenon by securing two major awards: Best Animated Feature and Best Song for its chart-topping track "Golden." The film, which follows K-pop superstars battling demons, triumphed over established contenders from Disney and Pixar, marking a significant win for the streaming giant.

### Public & Critical Reaction

Social media exploded with reactions to the Critics Choice Awards, with Twitter (X) buzzing with commentary on everything from fashion to acceptance speeches. Timothée Chalamet's public affection for Kylie Jenner was a prevalent topic, drawing both adoration and some lighthearted "cringe" from fans. Michael B. Jordan's stoic expression became an instant meme, demonstrating the potent impact of nuanced celebrity reactions in the digital age. Teyana Taylor's unbridled enthusiasm was widely celebrated, earning her the accolade of "hype woman of the year" and adding a vibrant energy to the broadcast. The overall sentiment highlighted the awards as a rich source of entertainment extending far beyond just the winners' list.

### Behind the Scenes / Background

This year, the show’s tradition of forecasting Academy Award winners continued, with several Critics Choice victors poised to carry their momentum forward. The return of Chelsea Handler as host for a fourth time underscores her consistent appeal and her adeptness at navigating the complex landscape of celebrity and industry accolades.

Timothée Chalamet's win for "Marty Supreme" and Owen Cooper's historic achievement underscore the emergence of burgeoning talent across film and television. The ceremony also spotlighted the growing influence of streaming platforms, with Netflix's "Adolescence" and "KPop Demon Hunters" securing multiple wins. As Hollywood moves closer to the Academy Awards, the Critics Choice results provide valuable insights into which films and performances are resonating most deeply with critics and, increasingly, the general public.
