## 'F1' Box Office Roars: Brad Pitt Film Crosses Rs 44.5 Crore in India

Brad Pitt's 'F1' is making waves at the Indian box office, picking up speed in its second weekend. The film's strong performance is driven by packed evening and night shows, signaling a promising run.

### Event/Topic Overview

The film 'F1', starring Brad Pitt, experienced a resurgence on its second Saturday, grossing an estimated Rs 5.75 crore. This boost brings the total India collection to Rs 44.5 crore.

Strong evening and night show attendance primarily fueled Saturday’s growth, particularly for the English 2D version, which saw an impressive overall occupancy rate of 57.42% across India.

With positive reviews and a lack of significant competition in its genre, 'F1' is well-positioned to continue its success. Projections indicate it could surpass Rs 50 crore early next week.

### Key Highlights & Standouts

#### Strong Weekend Performance

After a steady first week and a slightly subdued second Friday, 'F1' rebounded strongly on Saturday. The film's estimated earnings of Rs 5.75 crore on Day 9 significantly contributed to its overall India net collection, reaching Rs 44.5 crore across all languages.

#### Occupancy Rates

The film's overall occupancy reached an impressive 57.42% across India. While morning shows were relatively modest, afternoon screenings jumped to nearly 59%, followed by packed evening (69%) and night shows (71.88%).

#### Critical Acclaim

ETimes rated 'F1' with 3.5 stars, praising Brad Pitt's portrayal of a driver with "laid-back arrogance." The review highlighted his shining presence in every scene, especially those showcasing his "retro swagger" and "monosyllabic replies" to the media. Damson Idris was also commended for his skillful balancing of raw talent with the demands of modern social media.

### Public & Critical Reaction

The film has received generally positive reviews, with particular praise for Brad Pitt's performance and the film's engaging sports drama narrative. This positive reception has contributed to strong word-of-mouth, driving attendance, especially during evening and night shows.

### Significance & What's Next

The success of 'F1' highlights the continued appeal of Hollywood sports dramas in the Indian market. With no major competition in its genre currently, the film has a clear path to continue its box office momentum throughout the coming week.

If the film's upward trend continues on Sunday, it is projected to comfortably cross the Rs 50 crore mark early next week. This achievement would solidify its position as a successful Hollywood sports drama in India.

### Behind the Scenes / Background

Directed by Joseph Kosinski, 'F1' features an impressive supporting cast, including Javier Bardem, Kerry Condon, Damson Idris, and Tobias Menzies. Kerry Condon as Kate McKenna stands her ground as the APXGP technical director who’s trying to prove her mettle in the male bastion. Javier Bardem, as the flamboyant and desperate team owner, injects the narrative with charm.

The film's narrative blends the high-octane world of Formula 1 racing with compelling character arcs, creating an engaging experience for viewers. The ETimes review specifically noted, "Brad Pitt nails the role of a driver with laid-back arrogance, shining in every scene—whether he’s strutting in with retro swagger or brushing off the media with monosyllabic replies."

### Significance & What's Next
