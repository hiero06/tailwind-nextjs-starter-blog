## Netflix's 'Monster: The Ed Gein Story' Ending Explained: Did His Crimes Inspire Other Killers Like Ted Bundy?

Netflix's latest true crime sensation, "Monster: The Ed Gein Story," has captivated audiences, delving into the chilling narrative of one of America's most infamous serial killers. As viewers binge-watch the eight-episode series, many have been left questioning the blurred lines between fact and fiction, particularly regarding the show's controversial ending.

### Series Overview

Released on Friday, October 3, "Monster: The Ed Gein Story" is the highly anticipated follow-up in Ryan Murphy's acclaimed anthology series, which previously explored the cases of Jeffrey Dahmer and the Menendez brothers. The new season centers on serial killer Ed Gein, famously known as the Butcher of Plainfield, with Charlie Hunnam starring in the titular role.

The series transports viewers back to the 1950s in rural Wisconsin, where Gein's gruesome activities unfolded. It highlights how his disturbing crimes served as chilling inspiration for a number of classic horror movies, including iconic films like "Psycho," "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," and "The Silence of the Lambs."

### Key Highlights & Standouts

#### Netflix's Chilling Anthology Continues

Co-created by Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan, "Monster: The Ed Gein Story" meticulously recreates the twisted world of Ed Gein. The series builds on the success of its predecessors, offering a deep dive into the psychology and lasting impact of a killer whose legacy extends far beyond his direct victims.

#### Charlie Hunnam's Portrayal of Ed Gein

Charlie Hunnam delivers a compelling performance as Ed Gein, crafting a portrayal that has generated considerable discussion among viewers. According to Netflix's Tudum, Hunnam's distinctive high-pitched voice for Gein was inspired by an actual audio tape recorded upon Gein's arrest, which has never been publicly released due to Miranda rights issues. Hunnam's interpretation was also deeply influenced by Gein's unhealthy and all-consuming relationship with his mother, Augusta (played by Laurie Metcalf).

#### Horror Inspirations: Psycho, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Silence of the Lambs

One of the most fascinating aspects highlighted by the series is the profound influence Ed Gein's crimes had on popular culture. Many viewers are just now discovering that his macabre acts directly inspired some of the most enduring and terrifying horror films ever made, solidifying his place as a real-life figure whose story continues to haunt the silver screen.

#### Ed Gein's Real Crimes: Beyond the Fiction

While the series takes creative liberties, it's crucial to distinguish Ed Gein's confessed crimes from the show's fictionalized elements. In reality, Gein confessed to killing two people: 58-year-old Plainfield hardware store owner Bernice Worden and 51-year-old tavern owner Mary Hogan, both with a firearm. His other crimes included grave robbing, exhuming bodies, and transforming human remains into various household items found in his home, contributing to his chilling reputation.

### Public & Critical Reaction

The ending of "Monster: The Ed Gein Story" has left many fans "confused," leading to widespread discussion across social media platforms. Viewers have expressed feeling disoriented by the blending of historical facts with Gein's fantasies and delusions. Comments ranging from "This is the most I’ve ever googled/questions during a show" to "I’m super confused. And disappointed" reflect a divided opinion on the show's narrative approach, with some questioning whether certain events were real or purely mythical.

### Behind the Scenes / Background

Co-creator Ian Brennan shed light on the creative decisions behind the series' ending, describing it as an "atonal note" that fittingly concludes Gein's deeply strange and dark journey. Brennan explained that the finale, originally titled "Momma's Boy," evolved to explore Gein's dark legacy and his influence on other serial killers. He noted the intention was to show Gein's bizarre satisfaction in having "made a mark" despite his gruesome acts.

The series also incorporates additional true-to-life details beyond Gein's crimes, such as the fact that his gravestone has repeatedly been stolen, hinting at his enduring and unsettling presence even after death. In real life, Ed Gein was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1957, pleading not guilty by reason of insanity, which led to his time in mental institutions.

### Significance & What's Next

The series powerfully illustrates Gein's "dark legacy," showing how his actions created a blueprint for future real-life serial killers like Richard Speck and Ted Bundy, who were reportedly influenced by his story. This exploration into the ripple effect of extreme violence underscores Gein's lasting, albeit horrific, impact on criminology and popular culture. The show solidifies his place as a figure whose story continues to fascinate and horrify, prompting crucial conversations about mental illness and the origins of evil.

While the series concludes with Gein's death, the discussions it sparks about truth, delusion, and historical impact are far from over. "Monster: The Ed Gein Story" is currently streaming on Netflix, inviting viewers to grapple with its unsettling portrayal and ponder the real-life inspirations behind horror's most iconic villains.
