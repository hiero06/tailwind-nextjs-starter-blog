Pierce questioned Embiid’s commitment to his physical condition, suggesting that Embiid needs to slim down to alleviate pressure on his knees. Pierce stated, “_I am not sure if Embiid’s knees are going to hold up. He’s gotta slim up, I think, just to take pressure off his knees, just because he’s heavy. The same with Zion. They have got to slim up._” He added he would be watching Embiid's condition closely during the preseason.

### Public & Critical Reaction

Embiid's recovery is particularly significant for the 76ers, who are hoping he will be ready for preseason games in early October against the New York Knicks in Abu Dhabi. His ability to return to full form will be a major factor in the 76ers' aspirations for a deep playoff run.

### Behind the Scenes / Background

Following what seemed to be a fruitful conversation, Morey told the media that the All-Star was recovering well and making promising progress on his way back to the team, stating, “_He’s very engaged, attacking rehab. Doing everything he can to be out there. He had a meeting with [the surgeon] this week. All things, to use a NASA term, are nominal. Things are going well and [as] expected, and we expect that to continue_."
