## Jenna Dewan's Forgotten On-Screen Romance Before 'The Rookie'

Before Jenna Dewan captivated audiences as Bailey on "The Rookie," she shared the screen with her current co-star Eric Winter in a lesser-known series. Their on-screen chemistry ignited in a world of witches and warlocks, offering a different dynamic than their roles in the hit ABC show.

### Event/Topic Overview

Jenna Dewan and Eric Winter, now recognized as Bailey and Tim on "The Rookie," previously starred together as love interests in the series "Witches of East End." The show, which aired for two seasons on Lifetime, explored the lives of witches and their complex relationships.

"Witches of East End" centered around Joanna Beauchamp (Julia Ormond) and her two daughters, Freya (Jenna Dewan) and Ingrid (Rachel Boston), as they navigated their magical heritage. The series delved into themes of family, love, and the supernatural, but was ultimately cancelled before reaching a satisfying conclusion.

### Key Highlights & Standouts

#### On-Screen Chemistry: Jenna Dewan and Eric Winter

In "Witches of East End," Jenna Dewan played Freya, a spunky and free-spirited witch, while Eric Winter portrayed Dash Gardiner, her love interest. Their characters were deeply intertwined in the show's storylines, creating a compelling on-screen romance that predates their dynamic on "The Rookie."

#### Dramatic Storylines and Performances

One of the most impactful storylines involved Freya and Ingrid's apparent deaths, discovered by Joanna and Aunt Wendy in a shocking scene. Dewan and Boston delivered powerful performances, conveying the sorrow and shock of the situation effectively.

#### Challenges in Production

While the acting performances were generally strong, some viewers found the special effects and "powers" displayed by the witches and warlocks to be somewhat cheesy. This may have contributed to a decline in viewership during the second season, ultimately leading to the show's cancellation.

### Public & Critical Reaction

Despite a dedicated fanbase, "Witches of East End" struggled to maintain consistent viewership throughout its two-season run. While the actors received praise for their performances, the show's overall reception was mixed, with some critics pointing to inconsistencies in the plot and the quality of special effects.

### Significance & What's Next

While "Witches of East End" may not be widely remembered, it serves as a reminder of their versatility as actors and their ability to create compelling characters in diverse genres.

For fans of "The Rookie," knowing that Dewan and Winter shared a romantic connection in a past project adds another layer of appreciation to their current on-screen dynamic. It highlights their ability to adapt to different roles and maintain engaging performances, regardless of the storyline.
