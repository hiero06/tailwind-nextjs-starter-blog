## South Portland's Bold Vision: Charting the City's Future for 2026

This article delves into the ambitious agenda recently set by the South Portland City Council for 2026, outlining critical initiatives that will shape the city's environmental, economic, and social landscape for years to come.

### South Portland's Bold Vision for 2026

The South Portland City Council has clearly defined its strategic goals for 2026, prioritizing a comprehensive approach to environmental stewardship, intelligent land use, and essential infrastructure upgrades. These objectives are designed to proactively address the most pressing issues confronting the city, guided by Mayor Elyse Tipton's vision for practical, creative, and brave actions that residents can observe directly. The council aims for ongoing accountability to ensure plans translate into tangible progress.

### Key Highlights & Standouts

#### Portland Pipe Line Redevelopment: A Landmark Opportunity

One of the council's primary goals is to collaborate with the Portland Pipe Line Corporation on the substantial redevelopment and reuse of the 200 acres it possesses within the city. This expansive tract of land, held by a subsidiary of the Canadian oil company Suncor, constitutes a significant portion of South Portland's landscape. It includes a 100-acre tank farm near the high school and additional tanks and two piers near Bug Light Park—sites frequently criticized as eyesores and environmental hazards.

Speculation had circulated for months regarding Portland Pipe Line’s intention to divest its holdings. In response, the city previously sent a formal letter to Suncor, urging voluntary divestment, thorough land remediation before any sale, and collaborative efforts to transform these industrial parcels into new, beneficial uses. Mayor Tipton emphasized the council's commitment to ongoing dialogue with Suncor to help plan for South Portland’s future. Community members have already contributed ideas; a plan developed by SMRT Architects, hired by the city, envisioned removing the 19 aboveground tanks to create a vibrant, walkable neighborhood. This plan includes a high-density core, green spaces, and a lower-density periphery, alongside new paths and roadways to alleviate traffic on Broadway. This proposed development could introduce over 1,000 much-needed housing units, offering a mix of apartments, condos, and single-family homes.

#### Protecting Air Quality Through Enhanced Monitoring

The council has also committed to safeguarding the city's air quality through stringent monitoring and transparent reporting. For over a decade, residents have advocated for robust air quality protections, particularly in areas surrounding the tank farms. Mayor Tipton reiterated the council's objective to persistently advocate for state departments to maintain regular, clear, and fence-line monitoring. This goal follows an air quality study released last fall that detected above-average levels of benzene, a toxic chemical, along the fence line of the Pearl Street tank farm. State toxicologist Andrew Smith indicated that similar results could be anticipated from other sites within the city, highlighting short-term risks such as increased impact on white blood cells and long-term risks including a heightened chance for certain blood and bone marrow cancers.

#### Advancing the East/West Connector Project

A critical objective for the council is to explore and pursue avenues for connecting the city's eastern and western sectors for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers. This initiative is becoming increasingly vital as the western part of South Portland experiences continued development, according to Planning Director Milan Nevajda. A proposed crosstown connector roadway, intended to link Main Street and Highland Avenue, faced a significant setback late last year due to its estimated $26.45 million price tag. This cost was deemed too substantial given several other impending infrastructure projects, such as the Pearl Street pump station, slated for voter approval in the coming years. Mayor Tipton noted that the city is investigating opportunities to transform the connector into a regional project, seeking assistance from Scarborough and statewide entities, with initial conversations still pending. Additionally, the council aims to enhance safety for cyclists and pedestrians traveling between Wainwright Recreation Complex and the Cash Street neighborhood.

#### Bringing the Mahoney City Center Project to Bond

Another key council goal is to prepare a city building referendum for voters by the November 2026 ballot, necessitating a decision on the plan by June. Mayor Tipton stated unequivocally, “It’s not an option to do nothing. That would be irresponsible.” Last year, the City Council endorsed a plan to convert the former Mahoney Middle School into a comprehensive city hall campus, envisioned to incorporate a new police station, fire station, and public library. While preliminary cost estimates hovered around $74 million, more recent projections indicate a dramatic increase to $193.8 million. City spokesperson Shara Dee, a member of the city center committee, reported that if the entire cost were borrowed without alternative funding, the average homeowner’s annual property tax could see a 16% increase, or $1,160 per year. Despite exploring cheaper alternatives, members of the Mahoney City Center Committee concluded at their most recent meeting that these options did not yield sufficient savings to warrant removing essential elements envisioned for the proposed city services center.

#### Crafting a New Comprehensive Plan for Growth

The council also intends to pass and commence implementation of a new comprehensive plan, designed to guide city policy and growth over the next 15 years. The Comprehensive Plan Committee is actively soliciting community input on its draft until February 15 and will convene multiple times before presenting its final recommendation to the council. Key areas of focus identified by committee members include promoting intentional and balanced growth alongside economic transformation, increasing housing options and sustainable transportation, and actively working towards climate resilience and environmental stewardship. The plan meticulously outlines “unique growth zones”—areas where substantial and distinct development is anticipated. Notably, two of these zones, Nutter Hill and the eastern waterfront, currently feature petroleum tanks but are now designated for mixed-use development, including residential.

### Public & Critical Reaction

Public sentiment plays a significant role in South Portland's planning, with Mayor Tipton affirming that success is measured when "residents can see that their council is working to find practical, creative and brave ways for plans to become action." Community members have actively contributed ideas, particularly for the Portland Pipe Line land redevelopment, demonstrating strong public engagement. However, concerns have also surfaced, especially regarding the escalating costs of the Mahoney City Center project, with estimates suggesting a potential 16% increase in annual property taxes for the average homeowner, a point highlighted by city spokesperson Shara Dee. Furthermore, residents have expressed a decade-long desire for stronger air quality protections, particularly around tank farms, underscoring the council's mandate to address these long-standing community concerns.

### Behind the Scenes / Background

South Portland's strategic planning for its future employs a multi-faceted approach. The City Council's goals prioritize "ongoing action and accountability." This involves proactive engagement with entities like the Portland Pipe Line Corporation and its parent company, Suncor, which included sending a letter urging voluntary divestment and land remediation. The council also commissioned SMRT Architects to develop a comprehensive plan for the Portland Pipe Line land, demonstrating a structured approach to urban redevelopment. Similarly, the rigorous process for the Mahoney City Center project includes exploring various alternatives and assessing their financial implications before presenting a referendum to voters. The Comprehensive Plan Committee further exemplifies this thoroughness by collecting extensive community input on its draft plan, ensuring that future city policy and growth reflect broad community needs and aspirations.

### Significance & What's Next

The ambitious goals set by the South Portland City Council for 2026 mark a critical period of transformation for the city. These initiatives collectively aim to address pressing environmental, economic, and social challenges, positioning South Portland for sustainable growth and an enhanced quality of life. The potential redevelopment of the Portland Pipe Line land holds immense cultural and economic significance, promising new housing and vibrant community spaces. Ongoing efforts in air quality monitoring and the pursuit of an East/West connector will directly impact residents' health and daily lives. Upcoming milestones include the Comprehensive Plan Committee's final recommendations, potential regional collaborations for the connector project, and the crucial November 2026 ballot for the Mahoney City Center project referendum, which will require residents to make a significant decision about the city's infrastructure and financial future. These efforts highlight South Portland’s commitment to proactive urban planning and environmental stewardship.
