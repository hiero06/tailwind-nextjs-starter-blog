## A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms Episode 5: India Release Date, Time, and Everything You Need to Know

Anticipation for the penultimate episode of *A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms*' first season is reaching a fever pitch as the legendary Trial of Seven approaches. This *Game of Thrones* prequel has captivated audiences with its more personal, chivalric focus, and Episode 5 is poised to be its most action-packed installment yet.

### Event Overview: A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms Episode 5

Titled “In the Name of the Mother,” the fifth episode of *A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms* is slated for its global premiere on February 15, 2026, in the United States. Indian viewers can expect it to become available on Monday, February 16, 2026. This prequel series, based on George R.R. Martin’s novella "The Hedge Knight," chronicles the adventures of Ser Duncan the Tall (Dunk) and his young squire, Egg, nearly a century before the events of the original *Game of Thrones*.

For Indian fans, the episode is set to drop at 8:30 am IST. JioHotstar holds the exclusive streaming rights in India, offering the series in multiple languages. This installment picks up the high-stakes narrative after Dunk's arrest for defending a puppeteer from the cruelty of Prince Aerion Targaryen.

### Key Highlights & Standouts: The Trial of Seven

The climactic event of *A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms* Episode 5 is the Trial of Seven, an ancient and rare form of judicial combat demanding seven champions on each side. Following the dramatic events of Episode 4, in which Ser Duncan was released from prison to gather his allies, the stage is now set for a massive confrontation at the Ashford tourney.

#### The Champions for Ser Duncan the Tall

Remarkably, the lowborn hedge knight Ser Duncan has rallied a group of warriors prepared to risk their lives for his cause. His most significant ally is Ser Lyonel Baratheon, famously known as the "Laughing Storm," who forged a friendship with Dunk during the tourney. They are joined by Ser Humfrey Beesbury, Ser Robyn Rhysling, and Ser Humfrey Hardyng. A poignant moment involves Raymun Fossoway, who pledges to fight for Dunk after his cousin, Ser Steffon,’s betrayal. Raymun is knighted on the spot by Ser Lyonel, enabling his participation. The most astonishing development, however, is the inclusion of Prince Baelor Targaryen, heir to the Iron Throne, who chooses to fight for Dunk to safeguard his nephew Egg’s future and uphold justice.

#### The Champions for Prince Aerion Targaryen

Prince Aerion "Brightflame" Targaryen commands a formidable team, bolstered by royal authority. His champions include his father, Prince Maekar Targaryen, and his brother, Prince Daeron. Their ranks are further strengthened by three members of the Kingsguard: Ser Donnel of Duskendale, Ser Roland Crakehall, and Ser Willem Wylde, all bound by oath to protect the royal family. Heightening the tension is the presence of the turncoat Ser Steffon Fossoway, who abandoned Dunk at the last minute to curry favor with the royal princes.

#### The Stakes of the Combat

Unlike the standard trials by combat familiar from later Westerosi history, the Trial of Seven is a chaotic melee. Should Dunk and his allies fall, the hedge knight faces execution, and the moral integrity of the Seven Kingdoms risks shifting further towards the cruelty epitomized by Aerion. Peter Claffey’s portrayal of Dunk and Finn Bennett’s performance as the villainous Aerion have been highlighted as major standouts in the series' inaugural season.

### Public & Critical Reaction

The series has proven a massive hit for HBO, with many fans commending its refreshing, grounded perspective on the world of Westeros. Public sentiment for the previous episode was overwhelmingly positive, as Episode 4 reportedly set new records on IMDb. Viewers have lauded the show for its successful adaptation of the "Tales of Dunk and Egg," maintaining a tone distinct from the grand political maneuvering of *Game of Thrones* and the dragon-centric warfare of *House of the Dragon*.

The "Trial of Seven" storyline has generated significant buzz across social media, with fans enthusiastically debating the outcome and praising Bertie Carvel's casting as the noble Prince Baelor. A growing consensus among critics suggests that *A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms* may even surpass its predecessors in character-driven storytelling and emotional resonance.

### Behind the Scenes / Background

*A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms* is set in 209 AC, a period of relative peace under the Targaryen dynasty, roughly a century before Daenerys Targaryen's birth. Showrunners George R.R. Martin and Ira Parker have emphasized themes of honor, mentorship, and the complex reality of chivalry in a world where "knight" is often merely a title. Diverging from the large-scale CGI battles of other franchise entries, this series prioritizes practical stunt work and intimate fight choreography, especially for the anticipated melee in Episode 5.

The production has meticulously adhered to the source material, "The Hedge Knight," ensuring the Ashford Meadow setting feels both lived-in and authentic to the novella’s descriptions. Young actor Dexter Sol Ansell has subtly handled Egg's central developmental arc, transitioning from a hidden prince to a humble squire.

### Significance & What's Next

The resolution of the Trial of Seven in Episode 5 will carry significant ramifications for the future of the Seven Kingdoms and the Targaryen lineage. This installment acts as the emotional climax of the first season, preceding the finale, titled “The Morrow,” set to air on February 22, 2026. Crucially, this episode solidifies the unique bond between Dunk and Egg, a partnership destined to shape them into two of Westeros's most legendary figures.

Looking ahead, HBO has already greenlit *A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms* for a second season, anticipated in 2027. This decision aligns with the franchise's broader strategy, as *House of the Dragon* Season 3 is also targeting a 2027 release. For devotees of George R.R. Martin’s world, the coming years promise a steady stream of content as the network continues to explore diverse eras of the Targaryen reign.

### Conclusion

As *A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms* Episode 5 readies for streaming, anticipation for the Trial of Seven is at an all-time high. With Ser Duncan the Tall confronting seemingly impossible odds against royal power, this installment is poised to define the "Hedge Knight's" legacy. Be sure to tune in on February 16 at 8:30 am IST on JioHotstar to witness the battle for justice in Westeros. Continue to follow the season as it progresses toward its highly anticipated finale!
