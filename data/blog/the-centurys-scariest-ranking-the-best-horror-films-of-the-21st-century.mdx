## The Century's Scariest: Ranking the Best Horror Films of the 21st Century

The 21st century has undeniably unleashed a torrent of truly impressive horror films, revolutionizing the genre with innovative storytelling and a keen eye on modern anxieties. As Halloween approaches, it's the perfect time to explore the scariest films that have defined this new era of frights.

### A New Era of Fear: Charting 21st-Century Horror

While the last millennium gave us iconic monsters like Dracula and Frankenstein, alongside seminal villains such as Jason Voorhees and Leatherface, horror films since 2001 have carved out their own revolutionary path. Filmmakers are adeptly utilizing new technology and contemporary issues to delve into the darker aspects of humanity, with the internet expanding our exposure to notable terrors from around the globe.

The genre has also embraced an "artful bent," allowing visionaries like Jordan Peele and Ari Aster to create vital and impactful films that resonate deeply with audiences. This definitive ranking aims to showcase the most compelling and terrifying cinematic achievements of this century, offering an essential guide for anyone seeking a truly memorable freakout.

### Unforgettable Frights: Key Highlights from the Top Horror Films

From chilling psychological thrillers to groundbreaking found-footage epics and socially conscious narratives, the 21st century has truly been a golden age for horror cinema. Here are some of the standouts that have left an indelible mark on audiences.

#### No. 1: 'Kill List' (2012)

Ben Wheatley's brilliant and blistering work introduces a British soldier turned hitman who uncovers strange details on his various jobs. What begins as a crime thriller morphs into something far more sinister and unsettling by its shocking conclusion, defying expectations and leaving viewers utterly stunned.

#### No. 2: '28 Days Later' (2003)

Often hailed as the best zombie movie outside of George Romero's legacy, this film starkly captures post-apocalyptic life. Cillian Murphy wakes from a coma to a bizarrely deserted London, confronting rage-filled, running creatures that offer a brutally realistic and harrowing vision of infection and survival.

#### No. 5: 'Get Out' (2017)

Jordan Peele earned instant-classic status with his socially relevant tackling of modern racism. Daniel Kaluuya's teary, wide-eyed shocked face as his character enters the abominable Sunken Place, courtesy of his white girlfriend's evil parents, remains one of the most indelible horror-film sights this millennium, praised for its sharp commentary and thrilling execution.

#### No. 6: 'Hereditary' (2018)

Ari Aster's disturbing debut is a spectacular implosion of a family, featuring Toni Collette's heartbreaking performance. Its occult leanings, horrifying imagery, and the presence of a demon king elevate it to all-time status, making it a profoundly unsettling experience.

#### No. 8: 'The Babadook' (2014)

This emotionally fraught tale explores the deteriorating mental state of a single mother and the appearance of Mr. Babadook, an expressionistic storybook monster. It masterfully blurs the lines between psychological torment and supernatural threat, creating a truly terrifying and resonant film.

#### No. 9: 'It Follows' (2015)

Maika Monroe stars in this eerie thriller about a young woman hounded by a shape-shifting, sexually transmitted curse. This high-concept antagonist provides constant stress and gives the film an extraordinary, infectious life, making it a standout for its unique premise.

#### No. 15: 'The Cabin in the Woods' (2012)

A genre-deconstructing wonder, this clever thriller references nearly every horror trope. It starts with teens venturing to a cabin before revealing a meta-conceit underneath, playing with audience expectations and delivering a truly inventive experience.

#### No. 16: 'Shaun of the Dead' (2004)

Edgar Wright's horror comedy expertly lampoons the undead genre, just as zombies were lumbering all over pop culture. With LPs as weapons and a fantastic Queen needle drop, the film's real secret sauce is the lovable best friendship between Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, offering laughs amidst the scares.

#### No. 18: 'Talk to Me' (2023)

Sophie Wilde shines in this new-school possession movie, where partying kids make viral social-media videos by getting possessed via a mysterious embalmed hand. They soon discover the grave dangers of "liking and subscribing" to unknown spirits, a modern take on an ancient fear.

#### No. 59: 'Donnie Darko' (2001)

This crazy psychological thriller grapples with whether it's truly a horror movie. Jake Gyllenhaal's character dealing with an aircraft engine in his bedroom and interacting with a giant rabbit named Frank, who foretells doomsday, provides all the answer needed for its unsettling premise.

### Public & Critical Reaction

The 21st century has witnessed a surge in horror films that are not only financially successful but also critically acclaimed, often sparking fervent discussions and earning "instant-classic" status. Films like "Get Out" garnered widespread praise for its sharp social commentary, while "Hereditary" was lauded for its terrifying imagery and powerful performances, solidifying its place among the genre's best.

The critical success of movies like "The Ring," which ignited American interest in the original "Ringu" and other outstanding Asian horror, demonstrates how these films have broadened horizons. Audiences have embraced the genre's evolution, appreciating its "artful bent" and thoughtful storytelling that pushes boundaries beyond traditional jump scares, fostering a deeper engagement with the narratives and their underlying themes.

### Behind the Scenes / Background

The landscape of 21st-century horror has been shaped by a new generation of visionary directors alongside established masters. Filmmakers like Rose Glass ("Saint Maud"), Sam Raimi ("Drag Me to Hell"), and John Carpenter (whose original inspired "Halloween" 2018) have continued to influence the genre.

Jordan Peele ("Get Out," "Us") and Ari Aster ("Hereditary," "Midsommar") are often cited as worthy successors to horror legends, bringing artful and thought-provoking narratives to the forefront. The success of "found-footage" subgenres, exemplified by films like "REC" and "Paranormal Activity," showcases innovative storytelling techniques that immerse audiences in terrifying realities. Actors such as Jake Gyllenhaal, Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Daniel Kaluuya, and Ethan Hawke have delivered memorable performances, bringing depth and intensity to these unforgettable tales of terror.

### Significance & What's Next
