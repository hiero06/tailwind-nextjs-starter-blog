## Morfydd Clark Explores Shakespeare's Enduring 'Hamlet' with Riz Ahmed

Morfydd Clark, celebrated for her intense performances, steps into the iconic role of Ophelia in a modern film adaptation of William Shakespeare’s 'Hamlet.' This new cinematic rendition, starring Riz Ahmed, promises a gritty re-examination of classic themes that resonate powerfully with today's world. Clark discusses the profound relevance of the drama, highlighting its exploration of wealth, suffering, and societal structures.

### Event/Topic Overview

Morfydd Clark stars as Ophelia in Aneil Karia's contemporary adaptation of 'Hamlet,' opposite Riz Ahmed as the titular, troubled prince. The Welsh actor, known for her roles in 'Saint Maud' and 'The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power,' brings her distinctive intensity to one of Shakespeare's most tragic heroines. The film is scheduled to premiere in cinemas on Friday, February 6th, 2026, offering a fresh perspective on the timeless drama.

This production aims to highlight the perennial relevance of Shakespeare's work, particularly 'Hamlet,' by connecting its historical themes of power and wealth disparity to modern societal issues. Clark emphasizes that the play's core message—about the suffering of many for the enrichment of a few—feels "painfully relevant" in today's context.

### Key Highlights & Standouts

#### Morfydd Clark's Portrayal of Ophelia

Clark offers a nuanced interpretation of Ophelia, delving into the character's inability to assert herself despite possessing more apparent agency in this modern setting. She explores the tragedy of Ophelia being trapped and ultimately destroyed by "imagined rules" imposed by men. Clark likens her character to someone desperate for male validation, slowly fading into irrelevance. The actress expresses deep sympathy for Ophelia, recognizing the universal struggle of being confined by self-imposed, imaginary boundaries.

#### Shakespeare's Enduring Relevance

An astute interpreter of Shakespeare, Morfydd Clark is deeply fascinated by the playwright's continuing significance. She asserts that the rules and laws depicted in Shakespeare's world still permeate our own, rendering his dramas timeless. Clark believes that Shakespeare demands "sincerity and deliberateness," where "every word matters," distinguishing his work from some modern writing that prioritizes understatement.

#### Clark's Unique Acting Style and Background

Clark has built a career on appearing slightly untethered from ordinary reality, imbuing her performances with an "uncanny, otherworldly intensity," whether as a religious maniac in 'Saint Maud' or the elfish Galadriel. Born in Sweden to a Northern Irish-Glaswegian father and a Welsh mother, she grew up valuing imagination. Her struggles with ADHD and dyslexia in school found refuge in stories, especially Shakespeare and J.R.R. Tolkien, and she benefited greatly from audiobooks in her youth.

#### The Impact of Bilingualism and Dyslexia

Clark, who is "very dyslexic," learned to read and write in Welsh first due to its phonetic nature, which initially made her struggle with English. As a teenager, she found comfort in the shared difficulty of Shakespeare, realizing that everyone found it challenging. Growing up bilingual profoundly shaped her, fostering "different parts of your mind" and offering "a different mode in Welsh than in English."

#### Influence of Astrid Lindgren

Despite not learning the Swedish language, Clark was deeply influenced by Astrid Lindgren, the creator of Pippi Longstocking, during her childhood. Lindgren's portrayal of children with "huge agency" profoundly shaped Clark's own perspective and approach to storytelling and character interpretation.

### Public & Critical Reaction

The anticipation for this modern take on 'Hamlet' is palpable, fueled by Clark's powerful assertion that the play revolves around "the suffering of many to make a few people very wealthy"—a sentiment she finds "painfully relevant." This gritty, rough-hewn production is expected to confirm Clark's conviction in Shakespeare's ongoing significance as a mirror to contemporary society. Her previous roles, like the unhinged nurse in 'Saint Maud,' which resonated strongly during the pandemic year and earned her a Bafta Cymru, have cemented her reputation for intense and compelling performances, setting high expectations for her portrayal of Ophelia.

### Behind the Scenes / Background

Morfydd Clark's journey into acting was shaped by a unique upbringing. She struggled with the structure of conventional schooling due to ADHD but thrived in the world of stories. After leaving school at 16, she trained with the National Youth Theatre of Wales before attending Drama Centre London, where the intense, deadline-driven environment proved to be a better fit than her earlier education. Her Celtic heritage—her father's tragic folk songs, her grandmother's amateur dramatics, and a Welsh-language school fostering creativity—is credited for her remarkable acting range and deep connection to storytelling.

### Significance & What's Next

This modern adaptation of 'Hamlet,' starring Morfydd Clark and Riz Ahmed, represents a continued effort to make classic drama accessible and relevant to contemporary audiences. By emphasizing themes of economic disparity and power dynamics, the film encourages viewers to "examine the world you live in." For Clark, this role further solidifies her position as one of the most distinctive and enchanting actors of her generation, capable of bringing otherworldly intensity to complex characters. This 'Hamlet' adaptation is set to open in cinemas on Friday, February 6th, offering a significant cultural event for film and theatre enthusiasts alike. The production underscores how William Shakespeare's narratives remain vital in understanding the human condition and societal challenges.

### Conclusion

Her insights into the play's themes of wealth, suffering, and individual agency underscore the enduring power of Shakespearean drama.
