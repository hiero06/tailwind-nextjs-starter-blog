## Love Island USA Cast Transformations: Nose Jobs, Fillers, and More Revealed!

Season 7 of Love Island USA has captivated audiences with its drama and romance. But before stepping into the villa, some of the stars underwent significant transformations, including nose jobs and fillers, as revealed by experts.

### Love Island USA Cast's Plastic Surgery Transformations

As Love Island USA Season 7 approaches its finale, attention has turned to the transformations some of the contestants underwent before appearing on the show. Experts have weighed in on the potential cosmetic procedures of Olandria Carthen, Huda Mustafa, Amaya Espinal, and Iris Kendall.

### Key Highlights & Standouts

Several Love Island USA contestants have sparked discussion about their pre-show enhancements. Here's a closer look at some of the standout transformations:

#### Huda Mustafa: Refined Nasal Tip and Lip Fillers

Huda, who has been open about her plastic surgery, showcased her April 2025 nose job on TikTok. According to experts Dr. Vivek Bansal, MD, and Dr. Badreshia-Bansal, her "post-photo aligns with a refined nasal tip and smoother bridge," suggesting a surgical rhinoplasty. They also noted the possibility of lip fillers, contributing to her fuller lips, and smoother skin texture potentially from laser resurfacing.

#### Olandria Carthen: Cheek Prominence and Jawline Contouring

For Olandria, the doctors speculated about "significant cheek prominence, this could be due to filler or fat transfer to the midface." Her sharper jawline might be the result of filler sculpting or non-surgical contouring like Kybella or radiofrequency. Makeup contouring could also play a role in enhancing her cheek and jaw structure.

#### Amaya Espinal: Streamlined Nose and Increased Lip Volume

Fan-favorite Amaya's nose appears "more streamlined with softer angles," potentially from a minor rhinoplasty or filler, according to the doctors. They also noted an increase in lip volume, suggesting lip filler, while also giving credit to camera angles and contouring for her refined look.

#### Iris Kendall: Refined Nasal Bridge and Midface Filler

The doctors believe Iris's "nasal bridge and tip look more refined and narrower compared to earlier photos, suggesting rhinoplasty." They also noted the possibility of "subtle midface filler contributing to a lifted appearance.”

### Public & Critical Reaction

The transformations of the Love Island USA cast have generated significant buzz online, with fans expressing a mix of surprise and admiration. The openness of some contestants about their procedures has been met with both praise and scrutiny, sparking conversations about beauty standards and personal choices.
