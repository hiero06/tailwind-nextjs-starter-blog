## Joe Burrow Ruled Out: Bengals Confirm Decision for Patriots Game

Cincinnati, OH – The speculation has ended for Bengals fans and fantasy football managers alike. The Cincinnati Bengals have officially confirmed that franchise quarterback Joe Burrow will remain on injured reserve and has been ruled OUT for the NFL Week 12 matchup against the New England Patriots. Veteran Joe Flacco is now set to lead the Bengals offense in this crucial home game.

### Burrow Sidelined for Week 12: An Overview

The Cincinnati Bengals are poised to face the New England Patriots at Paycor Stadium on Sunday at 1:00 p.m. EST, albeit without their star quarterback. Despite significant progress in his recovery from a turf toe injury that has sidelined him since Week 2, Joe Burrow was not activated from the injured reserve list. This decision follows a week of observation where Burrow was a full participant in practice and reported no setbacks, initially fueling hopes for his return.

However, the organization has opted for a cautious approach with their cornerstone player. This move places veteran Joe Flacco in line for his sixth consecutive start for a Bengals team currently holding a 3-7 record. The challenge is amplified as Cincinnati prepares to face a formidable 9-2 Patriots squad, further hampered by the absence of star wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase, who is serving a one-game suspension.

### Key Highlights & Strategic Standouts

With Burrow's status confirmed, attention shifts to how the Bengals will adapt against a top-tier opponent. The team's performance will largely depend on a reshaped offensive strategy and key players embracing larger roles.

#### Flacco Takes the Helm Once More

Joe Flacco will once again command the offense for Cincinnati. In his previous starts, the offense has evolved to leverage his strengths as a traditional pocket passer, leading to an increase in plays run directly under center and a noticeable improvement in the run game. Game projections reflect this balanced approach: Flacco is anticipated to throw for approximately 249 yards, while running back Chase Brown is expected to lead the ground attack with 61 rushing yards. Flacco's synergy with the receiving corps, particularly Tee Higgins, will be vital for sustaining drives.

#### Offensive Adjustments Without Key Stars

The simultaneous absence of both Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase presents a monumental challenge for the Bengals' offense. Without Chase, the primary receiving responsibilities will squarely fall on Tee Higgins' shoulders. Projections forecast Higgins leading the team with 73 receiving yards, and he carries a high probability of finding the end zone, with a 47.1% chance for an anytime touchdown. The offense will also look to players like Andrei Iosivas to step up in the passing game and exploit any mismatches presented by the Patriots' defense.

#### Defensive Pressure Mounts

While the offense navigates its personnel changes, the Bengals' defense faces its own set of hurdles. The unit has struggled for much of the season and is on a historically poor pace. With Trey Hendrickson also out, the defense will require other players to generate pressure. Cornerback DJ Turner has been a bright spot, playing at a Pro Bowl level, and the team will rely on him to secure his side of the field. Former first-round pick Myles Murphy, who delivered a solid performance last week, is expected to disrupt the Patriots' backfield and build on his recent success.

### Behind the Scenes: A Cautious Recovery Approach

The decision to keep Joe Burrow on the sideline was not made lightly. The franchise quarterback sustained the turf toe injury to his left big toe during the first half of the September 14 game against Jacksonville. Coach Zac Taylor emphasized that the choice prioritizes Burrow's long-term health and the team's future.

"I have to take into account what’s best for him," Taylor stated. "He’s coming back off an injury... I have to take into account what’s the best thing for him, what’s the best thing for the team and make the soundest decision." This sentiment underscores a strategic move to ensure Burrow is fully healed before returning to game speed, especially with a short week on the horizon.

### Significance & What's Next

Burrow's absence carries significant implications for the Bengals' current season and dramatically reshapes the outlook for their game against the Patriots. Following the news, predictive models and betting odds shifted considerably. Data analysis from Dimers, based on 10,000 game simulations, gives the Patriots a 72% chance of winning. These simulations project a final score of 27-21 in favor of the Patriots.

Despite the Patriots being clear favorites, simulations also indicate value in betting on the Bengals. The data suggests the Bengals (+7.5) have a 56% chance of covering the spread. Furthermore, taking the Bengals moneyline (+315) is identified as the best bet due to a 3.9% edge when comparing data-driven probabilities to available betting odds.

The primary reason for the team's caution appears to be the upcoming schedule. Burrow himself had indicated he was targeting the Bengals' Thanksgiving night game against the Baltimore Ravens for his return. This crucial AFC North divisional matchup holds far greater weight for Cincinnati's potential playoff hopes than the inter-conference game against New England. By holding him out this Sunday, the Bengals grant Burrow extra time to heal and prepare for a game that could define their season.

Assuming no major setbacks, all eyes will be on that primetime Thanksgiving showdown for Joe Burrow's anticipated return. Until then, the Bengals will need to rally around Joe Flacco and play complementary football to have a chance at upsetting the Patriots.

Joe Burrow's status is officially confirmed: he will not play today. While disappointing for fans eager for his return, the decision prioritizes his full recovery for a critical stretch later in the season. With Joe Flacco at the helm and key players like Tee Higgins and Chase Brown stepping into the spotlight, the Bengals face a tough test against the Patriots. Tune in this Sunday to see how the reconfigured Cincinnati squad performs, and keep an eye on practice reports next week for the latest on Burrow's much-anticipated Thanksgiving return.
