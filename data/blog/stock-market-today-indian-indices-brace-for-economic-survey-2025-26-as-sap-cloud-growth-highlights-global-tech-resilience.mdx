## Stock Market Today: Indian Indices Brace for Economic Survey 2025-26 as SAP Cloud Growth Highlights Global Tech Resilience

Global equities are navigating a complex environment characterized by eager anticipation of major policy decisions and contrasting sector-specific earnings results. As investors await India's crucial Economic Survey 2025-26, leading European tech firm SAP has offered a compelling glimpse into the robust growth of the enterprise cloud market, underscoring the disciplined momentum fueling long-term value creation across the technology sector.

Against this dynamic backdrop, investors tracking indices like the Nifty and global technology bellwethers, such as those monitoring Microsoft's stock performance, must weigh local policy risks against the sustained, foundational growth in AI and cloud services.

### Quick Context: Economic Surveys and Big Tech Earnings

For the Indian stock market, the immediate focus is on domestic policy, with equity benchmarks signaling a cautious or lower open on Thursday. This hesitation comes amid mixed global cues and eager anticipation of the Economic Survey 2025-26 in Parliament.

On the international front, the US stock market saw the S&P 500 top the 7,000 mark recently, reflecting underlying strength as investors await the Federal Reserve’s decision and upcoming Big Tech earnings releases. These earnings are critical, as they set the tone for the entire technology landscape and significantly influence valuations for major players like Microsoft (MSFT).

#### Immediate Market Signal: Nifty Signals Weak Start Near 25,365

Indian equities are poised for a weak start, with the Nifty 50 signaling a soft opening near 25,365. This caution follows a strong close on Wednesday, where the Sensex advanced 0.60% to 82,344.68 and the Nifty 50 settled at 25,342.75. Sectoral performance was uneven, with Media, Metals, Energy, Oil & Gas, Realty, and PSU Banks posting robust gains (1% to 4%), while FMCG, Consumer Durables, and Pharma stocks saw profit-taking.

#### Key Event: Union Finance Minister to Present Economic Survey 2025-26

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Economic Survey today, followed by a press briefing from Chief Economic Adviser V. Anantha Nageswaran. The survey offers crucial insights into India’s economic growth potential, inflation patterns, and fiscal consolidation strategies, thereby setting the stage for the upcoming Union Budget on February 1.

### What You Need to Know: Navigating Indian Support Levels and SAP’s Cloud Surge

Recent stock market trends in Asia reveal technical resilience amidst investor caution, while European tech results highlight aggressive digital transformation and robust financial strength.

#### Indian Index Outlook: Key Support and Resistance Levels

The Sensex maintains a positive market structure, holding 82,000 as a key support zone. A sustained rally is anticipated if the index holds above this level, potentially pushing toward 82,800 and 83,000. For the Nifty 50, its strength is reinforced by its position above the 200-day moving average at 25,170. The 25,200 level serves as immediate support, with the 25,450-25,500 range acting as key resistance.

#### Core Development: SAP Meets Revenue and Exceeds Profit Outlook for FY2025

In stark contrast to the cautious sentiment in Asia, SAP SE released robust financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended December 31, 2025. SAP not only achieved its revenue outlook but also surpassed non-IFRS operating profit and free cash flow targets for the full year 2025. Total revenue was up 8% (up 11% at constant currencies) for the full year, reaching €36.80 billion.

#### Financial Discipline: Total Cloud Backlog Up 30% at Constant Currencies

SAP’s strategic focus on cloud transformation yielded impressive growth metrics. Full year cloud revenue was up 23% to €21.02 billion (up 26% at constant currencies). Crucially, the total cloud backlog, a key indicator of future stability, surged by an impressive 22% (30% at constant currencies) to a record €77.29 billion. This strategic shift increased the share of more predictable revenue for the full year to 86%.

#### AI as Growth Driver: SAP Business AI Included in Two-Thirds of Q4 Cloud Orders

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming central to SAP’s business. CEO Christian Klein emphasized that "SAP Business AI has emerged as a primary growth driver, being included in two thirds of our Q4 cloud order entry." This seamless integration, coupled with strong AI adoption across the ERP Suite, highlights AI's foundational role in propelling large-scale enterprise transformation projects like "RISE with SAP."

### Why This Matters (Implications): Policy, Cloud Wars, and the MSFT Stock Price Equation

The confluence of market caution preceding policy decisions and robust growth in enterprise technology has significant implications for global investment strategy.

In India, the Economic Survey and subsequent budget will shape capital expenditure projections and fiscal deficit targets. Conservative figures, for instance, could prompt profit-taking if the Sensex falls below the 82,000 support level. Conversely, optimistic growth projections could sustain the ongoing rally.

Globally, SAP’s performance offers compelling insights into the health of the enterprise software industry. SAP’s core focus on Cloud ERP Suite revenue, which grew 32% at constant currencies for the full year, indicates substantial ongoing investment by large corporations in digital transformation—a trend similarly driving growth for major competitors like Microsoft.

For investors monitoring Microsoft's stock price trajectory or questioning periodic dips, SAP's results serve as a strong indicator: demand for enterprise cloud services is robust and accelerating, propelled by AI integration. Any dip in Microsoft’s stock price would likely stem from temporary profit-taking or macroeconomic headwinds, rather than a fundamental decline in demand for its highly competitive SaaS and PaaS offerings, which compete directly with SAP's growing portfolio.

### What Experts Are Saying: SAP Leadership on Execution and AI

SAP’s executive team offered clear commentary on the factors underpinning the company's strong fiscal performance for 2025.

#### CEO Insight: Discipline Drives Long-Term Value

Christian Klein, CEO of SAP, stressed the importance of focused strategy, noting that "discipline will continue to drive long-term value creation." He added that the strong Q4 bookings, which resulted in 30% Total Cloud Backlog growth, established "a strong foundation for accelerating Total Revenue growth through 2027."

#### CFO Perspective: Strategy and Operational Discipline

Dominik Asam, CFO, highlighted operational effectiveness. He stated: "We closed 2025 on a high note, delivering robust operating profit and free cash flow, surpassing our expectations. This performance reflects focused execution, financial discipline, and the continued trust our customers place in us." He reiterated confidence in the strategy, citing the robust growth in SaaS and PaaS sectors.

### Potential Impact & Future Outlook

The outlook for 2026 points to continued bullishness in the tech sector, coupled with cautious optimism in emerging markets awaiting policy clarity. Today's stock markets are highly sensitive to forward guidance, and SAP has issued ambitious targets.

#### 2026 Outlook: SAP Targets €25.8–26.2 Billion Cloud Revenue

Looking ahead to 2026, SAP forecasts continued strong growth, projecting cloud revenue in the range of €25.8 and €26.2 billion at constant currencies, a 23% to 25% increase. Non-IFRS operating profit is anticipated to rise 14% to 18%, signaling a sustained margin expansion driven by cloud efficiency and operational discipline.

#### Capital Management: New €10 Billion Share Repurchase Program

Reflecting confidence in its future profitability and robust free cash flow generation (projected at approximately €10 billion in 2026), SAP has authorized a new share repurchase program totaling up to €10 billion, set to commence in February 2026. Such capital management initiatives typically boost investor confidence and support the company's stock valuation.

For Indian markets, the immediate future rests on the forthcoming policy announcements. Market behavior before the Union Budget will largely be shaped by the Economic Survey’s guidance on key metrics like GDP growth and fiscal deficit targets. Investors must monitor support levels closely, as a breach might trigger short-term profit-taking.

Today's global stock markets present a study in contrasts: with focused anticipation in India centered on the Economic Survey’s policy implications, juxtaposed against robust financial performance from global tech giants like SAP. For investors monitoring the evolving MSFT stock price and related Big Tech valuations, the robust growth in cloud and AI demonstrates that disciplined execution remains the primary driver of value creation in 2026. Stay tuned for further stock news following the key economic announcements.
