## Josh O'Connor Steals the Show in Rian Johnson's Critically Acclaimed "Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery"

The highly anticipated third installment in Rian Johnson's beloved murder mystery franchise, "Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery," has arrived on Netflix, immediately captivating audiences worldwide. While Daniel Craig returns as the iconic Benoit Blanc, it's the stellar performance of Josh O'Connor that has truly captivated critics and audiences alike.

### Quick Context

Three years after the global success of "Glass Onion," Rian Johnson once again plunges viewers into a complex web of deceit and intrigue with "Wake Up Dead Man." The film, which promises Benoit Blanc's "most personal case to date," has quickly become a fan favorite, garnering widespread acclaim almost instantly.

#### Key Release: Unraveling the Mystery on Netflix

"Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery" premiered on Netflix on December 12, 2025, instantly becoming a must-see event. Fans eagerly tuned in to witness Detective Benoit Blanc tackle a perplexing new murder at a small, upstate New York church, where "faith, secrets, and suspicion blur" within a compelling narrative.

#### Critical Acclaim: A Franchise Best?

The film has garnered an impressive 92% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, a testament to its gripping storyline and masterful execution. Beyond critical acclaim, Netflix subscribers have enthusiastically taken to social media, with many hailing "Wake Up Dead Man" as the "best Knives Out film yet" and their "favorite" of the trilogy, underscoring its prowess in keeping audiences engrossed until the very end.

### What You Need to Know

Rian Johnson's "Knives Out" franchise is celebrated for its meta-narrative approach to the murder mystery genre, consistently offering fresh perspectives while honoring classic structures. "Wake Up Dead Man" further cements this reputation, unfolding a narrative that is both deceptively simple and profoundly complex, rich with subversions and thematic depth that elevate it beyond a mere puzzle box.

#### The Benoit Blanc Saga Continues: Daniel Craig's Distinctive Return

Daniel Craig reprises his role as the charming, Southern-accented detective Benoit Blanc, who becomes entangled in a murder that deeply challenges his renowned rational mind. In this installment, Blanc confronts a case so peculiar it leaves him utterly baffled, ultimately leading to a personal revelation—a significant departure from his usual role as the sole purveyor of answers. Craig's nuanced portrayal remains a cornerstone of the franchise, providing the steady canvas against which the film's deeper themes are masterfully painted.

#### The Craft of Rian Johnson: Beyond the Puzzle

Director Rian Johnson masterfully crafts a narrative that delves into intricate theological and moral discussions, making "Wake Up Dead Man" the most thematically rich entry in the series. The film's central mystery revolves around the death of a pastor, replete with biblical parallels and potent symbolism, from the murder weapon's "devil symbolism" to the treasure dubbed "Eve’s apple." Johnson cleverly employs meta-dialogues to redirect the audience's focus, prompting them to look beyond the "how" of the murder and instead explore its profound "why" and thematic implications. This innovative approach allows the narrative to "unravel like a reverse origami," progressively revealing clearer shapes and deeper meanings.

#### O'Connor's Scene-Stealing Performance: Father Jud Duplenticy

While the entire cast of "Wake Up Dead Man" features an impressive ensemble cast, including Andrew Scott (of Fleabag fame), Mila Kunis, Jeremy Renner, Josh Brolin, Glenn Close, Kerry Washington, Cailee Spaeny, Daryl McCormack, and Thomas Haden Church, it is **Josh O'Connor** who has truly captivated audiences. Known for his critically acclaimed role as Prince Charles in "The Crown," O'Connor shines as Father Jud Duplenticy, a young, naive, and kind-hearted priest tormented by immense guilt. Viewers have universally lauded his performance, with many commenting that O'Connor is "absolutely owning the screen" and "steals the show" even from the brilliant Daniel Craig. His character's profound internal struggle and transformation become a central pillar of the film's emotional and thematic weight.

#### A Deeper Dive: Themes of Faith and Guilt

The film explores faith not merely in a religious context, but within broader belief systems, family structures, hierarchies, unwavering love, and the corrupting power of wealth. O'Connor's character, Reverend Jud, exemplifies this, channeling his deep-seated guilt into a fervent drive to become a helpful preacher. Josh Brolin’s Monsignor Jefferson Wicks, in turn, externalizes his childhood trauma, manifesting a personality cult around himself. This complex interplay of characters and their intense internal struggles elevates "Wake Up Dead Man" beyond a mere whodunnit, transforming it into a profound exploration of the human condition.

#### The Gothic Setting: An Upstate New York Church

Befitting its darker tone, "Wake Up Dead Man" transports viewers to a gothic upstate New York Catholic church. Intriguingly, despite this distinct American setting, the bulk of filming occurred in London, England, and its surrounding areas, with exterior shots captured at the Holy Innocents Church in Epping Forest, Essex. Production designer Rick Heinrichs detailed the meticulous process of locating a suitable UK church that could plausibly double for a mid-19th-century American neo-Gothic/Victorian structure. The church's actual interior, deemed too small and "disappointingly bland," was meticulously constructed from scratch on a sound stage. This elaborate set included detailed lighting rigs and a distinctive ambo (pulpit) designed to evoke Orson Welles' Father Mapple from "Moby Dick." A few establishing shots were indeed captured in Cold Spring, Putnam County, New York, effectively grounding the fictional setting with authentic American scenery.

### Why This Matters (Implications)

The success of "Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery" holds significant implications for the entertainment industry, the mystery genre, and the careers of its key talents, particularly Josh O'Connor and Rian Johnson.

Firstly, it underscores the evolving nature of blockbuster franchises. By pushing thematic boundaries and prioritizing character depth over simple plot twists, Rian Johnson continues to prove that intellectual engagement can indeed coexist with mass appeal. This approach challenges the notion that mystery films must adhere strictly to formula, paving the way for more innovative and thought-provoking narratives within popular genres.

Secondly, for Josh O'Connor, this role represents a pivotal moment in his career. His "scene-stealing" performance in a major Netflix production, alongside an established star like Daniel Craig, significantly elevates his profile beyond his acclaimed work in "The Crown." It positions him as a versatile talent capable of commanding the screen in high-profile, mainstream features, thus opening doors to a broader range of roles and firmly cementing his status as a leading actor.

Finally, for Netflix, the overwhelmingly positive reception and impressive Rotten Tomatoes score bolster its strategy of investing in original, high-quality content. The "Knives Out" franchise has proven to be a major draw, attracting both critical acclaim and a vast subscriber base, further solidifying Netflix's position as a powerhouse in content creation and distribution.

### What Experts Are Saying

The reception for "Wake Up Dead Man" has been overwhelmingly positive, with both critics and the viewing public lauding it with praise. The film's 92% rating on Rotten Tomatoes speaks volumes about its quality, yet it's the specific comments from audiences that most powerfully underscore its impact.

"On X (formerly Twitter), a wave of fans have enthusiastically hailed "Wake Up Dead Man" as the 'best Knives Out film yet,' with many naming it their 'favorite' of the trilogy," one source reports. Specific comments included declarations like, "Best movie in the franchise," and "I think #WakeUpDeadMan might be my favorite Benoit Blanc outing." Another viewer concluded, "Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery was an amazing film. It may even be the best of the 3, no easy feat."

Praise for the film's narrative and suspense was equally strong: "An incredibly funny, tense, and amazing film that keeps you guessing its entire runtime. It presents a massive mystery with many layers. It'll keep you guessing until the end," remarked an enthusiastic subscriber.

The spotlight, however, frequently shifted to Josh O'Connor's standout performance. "Daniel Craig is brilliant as always but it's Josh O'Connor who steals the show," one viewer observed, while another described his work as "fantastic." This sentiment was echoed by numerous commentators who noted O'Connor was "absolutely owning the screen" throughout the film.

Beyond audience reactions, the New Indian Express review lauded the film, stating, "Wake Up Dead Man is the most complex and thematically rich entry in the franchise yet," underscoring Rian Johnson's success in evolving the genre.

Even the intricate production details garnered attention, with production designer Rick Heinrichs explaining the challenges and triumphs of creating the film's unique setting: "it was devilishly hard to find a church [in England] that didn’t look at least several centuries too old for a U.S. church." He further elaborated on the decision to build the church's interior set from scratch, explaining that the real church's interior was "disappointingly bland" and too small for the narrative's demands.

### Potential Impact & Future Outlook

The immediate success and critical adoration of "Wake Up Dead Man" foreshadow a bright future for its key players and the broader mystery genre. For Josh O'Connor, his standout role as Father Jud Duplenticy cements his position as a major talent in Hollywood. This performance, following his Emmy-winning turn in "The Crown," showcases his ability to command a diverse range of characters across different genres. This pivotal performance is poised to generate a surge in high-profile film offers, further establishing him as a sought-after leading man with considerable range.

For Rian Johnson, the film’s critical and commercial triumph validates his audacious, thematic approach to the murder mystery. It solidifies his status as a visionary filmmaker capable of innovating within established genres. This success will likely empower Johnson to continue challenging creative boundaries in future installments of the "Knives Out" series and other projects, potentially inspiring other filmmakers to explore deeper narratives within genre cinema.

The "Knives Out" franchise itself is now firmly established as a powerhouse, with "Wake Up Dead Man" demonstrating its significant capacity for growth and thematic exploration. The audience's enthusiastic embrace of a more complex, morally layered mystery signals a robust appetite for intelligent, character-driven whodunnits. This trend could encourage other studios and platforms to invest more in sophisticated mystery narratives, moving beyond simplistic puzzles to explore rich character arcs and profound societal commentary. The franchise's future appears limitless, with Rian Johnson at the helm, promising more intricate and engaging adventures for Benoit Blanc and a rotating cast of "Wake Up Dead Man"-level talent.
