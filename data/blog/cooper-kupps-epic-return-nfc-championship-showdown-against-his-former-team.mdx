## Cooper Kupp's Epic Return: NFC Championship Showdown Against His Former Team

The NFC Championship Game between the Seattle Seahawks and the Los Angeles Rams is poised to deliver an electrifying showdown. Amidst the high stakes and fierce rivalry, one of the most compelling narratives revolves around veteran wide receiver Cooper Kupp. For fans eagerly asking, "Is Cooper Kupp playing today?" the answer is a resounding yes, as he prepares to face his former team, the Los Angeles Rams, at Lumen Field.

This highly anticipated clash promises drama, star power, and a deeply personal storyline for Kupp, whose journey embodies resilience and an unwavering competitive spirit on the sport's biggest stage.

### Event Overview: NFC Championship Game Rams vs. Seahawks

The Seattle Seahawks are gearing up to host the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship Game on Sunday, January 25, 2026, at Lumen Field in Seattle. This highly anticipated matchup is a significant rematch, as the two teams squared off in two regular-season contests, both decided by two points or fewer, setting the stage for an explosive playoff encounter.

Seattle enters this game with a formidable home advantage, boasting an impressive 11-1 record in playoff games at Lumen Field over the past two decades. The Rams, under Coach Sean McVay, also possess a strong championship pedigree, holding a 2-0 record in NFC title games since their return to Southern California. The game will be broadcast on Fox at 6:30 p.m. ET, with Kevin Burkhardt on play-by-play and Tom Brady providing analysis.

### Key Highlights & Standouts

The NFC Championship features a wealth of talent and intriguing storylines, none more personal than Cooper Kupp's return to face the Los Angeles Rams. It was with the Rams that he won Super Bowl LVI MVP and the 2021 AP Offensive Player of the Year award. Kupp, now donning the Seahawks' colors after being released by the Rams, brings a captivating "full-circle narrative" to this high-stakes game. While his production this season (47 catches, 593 yards, 2 touchdowns) may not match his historic 2021 campaign, his physical run-blocking and ability to make crucial plays remain invaluable to Seattle's offense.

#### Cooper Kupp's Impact and Resilience

Despite a more managed workload in practice to ensure a full season of availability, Cooper Kupp's presence is deeply felt. Seahawks running back Cam Akers, a former Rams teammate, lauded Kupp's consistency and leadership, stating, "He’s the same person every day, and you can count on him to be exactly where you need him to be every time. So, consistency, being a true leader without having to say much." Offensive coordinator Clint Kubiak also praised Kupp as having a "phenomenal Hall of Fame brain," drawing rave reviews for his willingness to block and deliver big plays in the passing game.

Kupp himself acknowledges the "extraordinary personal element" of facing his previous team, recognizing his journey as one of 53 players, but one marked by profound resilience. He admits to wishing for higher receiving yards this season, yet finds immense satisfaction in the team's collective success.

#### Sam Darnold's Playoff Redemption Arc

Seahawks Pro Bowl quarterback Sam Darnold enters his biggest career game while dealing with an oblique injury. Despite his limited practice reps, offensive coordinator Kubiak assured reporters, "He looks like Sam. He looks healthy to me." Darnold's recent performance, including a mistake-free 41-6 divisional round win over the 49ers, demonstrates his readiness. However, the Rams defense has been a formidable opponent, sacking him nine times and intercepting him six times in their last four matchups. His ability to conquer this "personal challenge" will be pivotal for Seattle's Super Bowl aspirations, especially after rallying the Seahawks to a franchise-record fourth-quarter comeback against the Rams in Week 16.

#### Star Power Across the Field

The game also features high-profile individual matchups. On the Rams' side, Matthew Stafford has enjoyed one of his most productive seasons, leading all quarterbacks in touchdowns and yards. Rookie sensation Puka Nacua, who previously dominated the Seahawks with 225 yards and two touchdowns in Week 16, will face All-Pro cornerback Devon Witherspoon in a physical battle. For the Seahawks, Jaxon Smith-Njigba has risen to WR1 status, setting a franchise record with 1,793 receiving yards, complementing the explosive run game led by Kenneth Walker III, who had a three-touchdown performance against the 49ers.

### Public & Critical Reaction

The anticipation for this NFC Championship Game is palpable, amplified by the close regular-season contests and the sheer talent on both rosters. ESPN's Stephen A. Smith has notably focused on Sam Darnold's past struggles against the Rams, highlighting how his performance will ultimately determine the Seahawks' chances for victory. The narrative of Darnold needing to overcome his "adversary" to reach the Super Bowl has captivated analysts and fans alike.

Adding to the intrigue is the unique storyline surrounding Cooper Kupp, a Super Bowl MVP facing the team that released him. The media has highlighted this as a "remarkable narrative," emphasizing the personal stakes involved for Kupp as he strives for another championship with a new franchise. His teammates, like Cam Akers, commend his quiet leadership—a quality that resonates deeply in a team sport where consistency often speaks louder than words.

### Behind the Scenes / Background

Cooper Kupp's journey to this NFC Championship Game reflects a career defined by both extraordinary highs and challenging setbacks. After his record-breaking 2021 season with the Rams, injuries plagued his subsequent seasons, contributing to his eventual release. Moving to Seattle, Kupp has adopted a smarter approach to his workload, limiting practice repetitions to ensure he could play a full season, which he nearly achieved, appearing in 16 out of 17 games and accumulating the second-most receiving yards on the team.

Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald has publicly appreciated Kupp's unwavering standards and availability, stating, "Are you surprised that the guy's put himself in a position to play great football? Not one bit. We’ve had a plan for him. Probably earlier in his career, the amount of workload that he would put in on a daily basis, I think that may have taken a toll on him. But he’s been really smart." This strategic management highlights the team's commitment to preserving their veteran playmaker.

On the Rams' side, the decision to release Kupp to sign Davante Adams created a significant offseason shift, adding another layer of personal drama to Sunday's clash. Adams himself is seeking his first Super Bowl appearance after four unsuccessful NFC Championship bids with the Packers, recognizing the "elusive" nature of reaching the league's pinnacle.

### Significance & What's Next

This NFC Championship Game holds immense significance for both franchises. For the Seahawks, a victory would mark their first trip to the Super Bowl in 11 years, solidifying Mike Macdonald's impact in his inaugural playoff season as head coach and completing Sam Darnold's remarkable mid-career revival from "draft bust to conference champion." The team's record-breaking 13 regular-season wins underline their ascendancy in the NFC.

For the Los Angeles Rams, a win would represent their third Super Bowl appearance under Sean McVay since relocating to Southern California, further cementing their status as a perennial contender. The potential of becoming the fifth playoff entrant since 2000 to win three road games and ultimately the Super Bowl adds historical weight to their quest.

Regardless of the outcome, the game will be a testament to the daily grind and resilience of players like Cooper Kupp, whose story is just "1 of 53," yet stands out as a focal point of this championship narrative. For fans, it's a "win or go home" scenario that promises unscripted drama and unforgettable moments on the path to Super Bowl LX.

As the Seattle Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams prepare for their NFC Championship clash, all eyes will be on the captivating storylines, from Sam Darnold's redemption arc to Cooper Kupp's emotional reunion with his former team. This game is more than just football; it's a testament to perseverance, strategy, and the relentless pursuit of greatness. Don't miss a moment of this epic showdown!
