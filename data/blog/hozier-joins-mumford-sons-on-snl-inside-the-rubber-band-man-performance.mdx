## Hozier Joins Mumford & Sons on SNL: Inside the "Rubber Band Man" Performance

The iconic Studio 8H is alight once more as Saturday Night Live returns from its mid-season hiatus with a formidable musical collaboration. Fans are abuzz as Irish singer-songwriter Hozier teams up with folk-rock giants Mumford & Sons for a performance poised to be a season highlight.

Following a break for the 2026 Winter Olympics, the long-running sketch comedy show is back for the 13th episode of its 51st season. With actor Connor Storrie making his hosting debut, all eyes are on the musical stage, where a significant collaboration featuring some of modern rock and folk music's most influential voices is set to unfold.

### Event Overview: Saturday Night Live Returns with Connor Storrie and Mumford & Sons

Saturday Night Live makes its highly anticipated return tonight, February 28, 2026, at 11:30 p.m. ET on NBC. This episode marks a pivotal moment for the show’s 51st season, signaling its move beyond the Olympic interruption. Hosting the evening is 26-year-old actor Connor Storrie, who recently shot to fame portraying Russian hockey player Ilya Rozanov in the acclaimed HBO drama *Heated Rivalry*. While Storrie anchors the comedy, the musical energy will be provided by Grammy Award-winning band Mumford & Sons.

This appearance marks Mumford & Sons' fourth time gracing the SNL stage, their last performance dating back to 2018. The band is currently celebrating the release of their sixth studio album, *Prizefighter*, which debuted on February 20. Central to their setlist tonight is the lead single, "Rubber Band Man," a track that notably features the towering Irish soul of Hozier. The collaboration has generated immense online interest, particularly concerning the unique chemistry between Marcus Mumford and the Irish singer.

### Key Highlights & Standouts

The convergence of Connor Storrie's major TV debut and Mumford & Sons' chart-topping musical comeback creates a compelling entertainment event. From the recording studio to the live stage, several key developments define this current era of the show.

#### The Prizefighter Album Launch

Mumford & Sons’ sixth studio effort, *Prizefighter*, has already made a significant impact on the industry. Produced by Aaron Dessner of The National, the album recently claimed the No. 1 spot on the U.K. charts, marking the band's fourth overall No. 1 album. The record is described as a product of spontaneity, born from a desire to operate without the constraints or patterns that defined the band's earlier work. This creative freedom is evident in the album's guest roster, which includes not just Hozier, but also Chris Stapleton, Gracie Abrams, and Gigi Perez.

#### Hozier’s Dynamic Collaboration on "Rubber Band Man"

The standout single "Rubber Band Man" has become a viral sensation, largely due to the vocal interplay between Marcus Mumford and Hozier. On SNL, the performance of this track is expected to showcase Hozier’s signature bluesy grit and soaring vocal range. As one of the most prominent Irish artists on the global stage, Hozier’s presence adds a layer of depth and soul to the band's evolved folk-rock sound. Fans have eagerly sought details on Hozier's SNL appearances, and this collaboration powerfully underscores his versatility as a performer.

#### The Heated Rivalry Hosting Debut

Connor Storrie’s transition from a breakout star in a hockey drama to an SNL host is a significant career milestone. His role in *Heated Rivalry* alongside co-star Hudson Williams has garnered him a dedicated following. While rumors have circulated about a potential guest appearance by Hudson Williams tonight, NBC has not officially confirmed the cameo. Nevertheless, Storrie’s inaugural turn leading Studio 8H is a high-profile performance that reflects his ascendant trajectory in Hollywood.

### Public & Critical Reception

The reaction to the new music and the SNL lineup has been overwhelmingly positive, albeit with some peculiar internet phenomena. Mumford & Sons’ *Prizefighter* has earned critical acclaim for its polished production and collaborative spirit. On the charts, it has successfully fended off competition from other major releases, including Olivia Dean’s *The Art of Loving* and Hilary Duff’s sixth studio album, *Luck… or Something*.

However, Hozier has also been making headlines for a very different reason: AI-generated music. Recently, a viral clip featuring an AI-generated Homer Simpson covering "Take Me To Church" began circulating on the Soulseek file-sharing network and social media platforms. Hozier himself addressed the phenomenon, calling it "silly" and "harmless" fun, while acknowledging the more serious long-term implications of AI being trained on music catalogs. This lighthearted reaction has only further endeared him to a fanbase that appreciates his authenticity and wit.

In the world of television, fans of *Heated Rivalry* are eagerly awaiting news of the show’s second season. With production set to begin this summer, Storrie's SNL appearance serves as a celebratory moment for the show’s success and a bridge to its upcoming chapters.

### Behind the Scenes: The Rebirth of Protest Music

Beyond the sketches and chart positions, Hozier’s work continues to be framed within the context of the "second coming" of protest music. Critics have noted that while protest songs were once considered a vestige of the 1960s, artists like Hozier, Fontaines D.C., and Kneecap are bringing social commentary back to the mainstream. Hozier’s discography, including tracks like "Butchered Tongue," "Swan Upon Leda," and "Nina Cried Power" (a collaboration with Mavis Staples), demonstrates his commitment to using music as a tool for political and social discourse.

The creation of *Prizefighter* also reflects this deeper artistic shift. Members Marcus Mumford, Ben Lovett, and Ted Dwane stated that the album was born from a space of "not being particularly concerned or constrained." This sense of freedom allowed them to collaborate with artists like Hozier to create music that feels urgent and alive, rather than manufactured purely for radio play. The spontaneity of the recording sessions under Aaron Dessner’s guidance has resulted in a sound that is both experimental and grounded in traditional folk roots.

### Significance & What's Next

The significance of tonight’s SNL episode extends far beyond a single night of television. It represents the enduring power of collaborative artistry in an era dominated by solo influencers and AI-generated content. By bringing together Hozier and Mumford & Sons, the show underscores the importance of human connection and the shared experience of live performance.

Looking ahead, the SNL schedule remains packed with star power. The March 7 episode is set to feature actor Ryan Gosling as host, with the virtual band Gorillaz serving as the musical guest. As for Hozier and Mumford & Sons, their successful collaboration on "Rubber Band Man" is likely to lead to further joint performances during the 2026 festival season. With *Prizefighter* dominating the charts and Hozier continuing to champion meaningful, socially conscious music, the landscape of modern rock looks more vibrant than ever.

Fans who miss the live broadcast can catch the full episode on Sunday for on-demand streaming via Hulu and Peacock. With *Heated Rivalry* season 2 on the horizon and new music continuing to roll out, this is just the beginning of a monumental year for everyone involved in tonight’s production.

Whether you are tuning in for the comedy of Connor Storrie or the vocal power of Hozier and Marcus Mumford, tonight's Saturday Night Live is an essential event for anyone who appreciates the intersection of television and music. Explore the work of these artists and keep an eye on the charts as *Prizefighter* continues its impressive run.
