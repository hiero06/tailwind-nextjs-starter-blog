## Blue Jays vs. Dodgers World Series Game 3: Battle for Control at Dodger Stadium

The 2025 World Series shifts to Dodger Stadium with the Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Dodgers locked in a thrilling 1-1 tie. Game 3 promises a pivotal matchup as both teams vie for control in what has already been a series of unforgettable moments and standout performances.

### Event Overview

Tonight marks Game 3 of the 2025 World Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers.

The series returns to Los Angeles after the teams split the first two games in Toronto. The Blue Jays dominated Game 1 with an 11-4 victory, showcasing their potent offense. The Dodgers, in turn, responded with a masterful 5-1 win in Game 2, highlighting their elite pitching and timely hitting.

### Key Highlights & Standout Performances

The 2025 World Series has already delivered high drama and individual brilliance from both sides.

#### Dodgers' Dominance in Game 2

In a crucial Game 2, the Los Angeles Dodgers delivered a classic performance to even the series. Yoshinobu Yamamoto was the undisputed hero, delivering his second consecutive complete game of the postseason. He allowed just one earned run while striking out eight Blue Jays batters, a historic feat that echoed Orel Hershiser's legendary 1988 postseason. Will Smith and Max Muncy provided the necessary offense, each launching solo home runs in the seventh inning to break a 1-1 tie and secure a 5-1 victory for Los Angeles.

#### Blue Jays' Offensive Explosion in Game 1

The Toronto Blue Jays roared to an 11-4 win in Game 1, powered by an unforgettable offensive surge. The most stunning moment came from Addison Barger, who launched the first pinch-hit grand slam in World Series history during a nine-run sixth inning that blew the game wide open. Ernie Clement ignited the rally with a go-ahead single off Emmet Sheehan, and Daulton Varsho contributed earlier with a tying two-run home run off Blake Snell, marking Snell's first home run allowed to a left-handed hitter on a four-seam fastball since June 2024.

#### Blue Jays Players to Watch

The Blue Jays boast a lineup capable of challenging any pitcher. Vladimir Guerrero Jr., with his .292 regular-season average and 23 home runs, carries a seven-game hitting streak into Game 3. George Springer, who hit .309 with 32 homers and 84 RBI, has five hits in his last five games. Bo Bichette, tied for second in batting average at .311, is slated to start at second base tonight, bringing his 18 home runs and 94 RBI back to the lineup after recovering from a knee sprain. Alejandro Kirk, a two-time All-Star, has been a staple in the middle of Toronto's lineup, known for his contact-first approach and timely hitting, including two solo shots in the ALDS. Under-the-radar mashers like Addison Barger, Ernie Clement, Nathan Lukes, and Daulton Varsho have also delivered critical moments in the postseason, proving Toronto is a tough out from top to bottom.

#### Dodgers Players to Watch

The Dodgers' star-studded roster features some of baseball's most dangerous hitters. Shohei Ohtani, the defending NL MVP, crushed a career-high 55 home runs with 102 RBI and a .282 average during the regular season. He is currently on a five-game hitting streak, including four home runs and six RBI in that span. Mookie Betts, with 20 homers and 82 RBI, and Freddie Freeman, who hit 24 homers and 90 RBI, are expected to ignite the Dodgers' offense further as the series progresses.

#### Tonight's Pitching Matchup: Glasnow vs. Scherzer

Tyler Glasnow enters Game 3 having allowed just one earned run in his last four appearances, including three postseason games with 18 strikeouts. He has struck out at least eight batters in his last two starts and previously limited the Blue Jays to two runs over 5 2/3 innings in an August outing. His success relies on his velocity and diverse pitch arsenal, particularly his high-90s four-seamer and wicked curveball, sinker, or slider, which often induce the "chase." However, the Blue Jays are noted for their plate discipline and low chase rate, posing a unique challenge for Glasnow.

For Toronto, three-time Cy Young winner Max Scherzer gets the nod. While he delivered a crucial performance in Game 4 of the ALCS, allowing only two earned runs in 5 2/3 innings, his regular season was marked by struggles, including a 5.19 ERA and allowing 19 home runs in 85 innings. A key for Scherzer tonight will be keeping the ball in the park against a powerful Dodgers lineup. The Dodgers, having recently faced Scherzer, know his tendencies, making this a stiff test for the veteran right-hander.

### Public & Critical Reaction

The World Series has captivated audiences, with Addison Barger's pinch-hit grand slam in Game 1 already etched into Canadian baseball lore. Yoshinobu Yamamoto's Game 2 masterpiece garnered immense praise, with experts suggesting it "might have saved the Dodgers' title hopes" by giving their bullpen a much-needed rest. While the Blue Jays' bullpen was widely regarded as a weakness before the series, their performance in the first two games, allowing only four runs over 7⅓ innings, has been surprisingly encouraging.

Conversely, the top of the Dodgers' lineup, featuring stars like Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts, and Freddie Freeman, has drawn critical attention for its "mediocrity" through the first two games, collectively going 4-for-21. ESPN experts anticipate a challenging outing for Scherzer against a familiar Dodgers lineup, while Glasnow is expected to continue his postseason success, though the Blue Jays' disciplined hitting could test his reliance on inducing swings outside the zone.

The Blue Jays' offense, expertly molded by hitting coach David Popkins, has been lauded as an "unlikely juggernaut." They finished fourth in runs scored during the regular season and have been the best offensive group this postseason, praised for making the most contact, striking out the least, and frustrating pitchers by driving up pitch counts. Popkins emphasizes playing to each hitter's strengths, creating a lineup where "there's not a lot of breathing room."

### Behind the Scenes & Background

Blue Jays hitting coach David Popkins, after overseeing the Twins' offense for three years, joined Toronto in October 2024. He has transformed the Blue Jays into an offensive powerhouse, prioritizing individual strengths and smart hitting in advantage counts. This philosophy has fostered a team identity that grinds out pitchers and scores in diverse ways.

Behind some of the key performances are fascinating backstories. Prior to his historic grand slam in Game 1, Addison Barger had just rushed back from Florida for the birth of his third child and even crashed on a pullout couch in teammate Davis Schneider's hotel suite. Alejandro Kirk, now an All-Star with a five-year, $58 million contract, signed with the Blue Jays for a mere $7,500 out of Mexico, demonstrating an impressive rise from unheralded prospect to integral core member. Nathan Lukes, another Blue Jay contributor, waited ten seasons in the minors before making his major league debut at age 28, a testament to his perseverance. Daulton Varsho, originally a catcher, successfully transitioned to become one of baseball's best defensive center fielders, highlighting the team's adaptability and player development.

### Significance & What's Next

Game 3 is a pivotal moment in the World Series, often referred to as a "series swing game." The team that takes a 2-1 lead, especially on their home field, significantly increases their chances of winning the championship. For the Dodgers, who have won 10 of their 12 playoff games this postseason, securing this game would put them in a dominant position. They boast an impressive 57-30 road record (5-1 in the postseason), while the Blue Jays hold a 43-43 road record (3-2 in the postseason).

A key strategic battle revolves around the bullpens. The Dodgers' bullpen remains a major question mark, especially with the loss of high-leverage specialist Alex Vesia for the series. This presents Toronto with a "ticket to take back control" by forcing Dodgers starters to exit early and expose their relief corps. The Blue Jays' strategy will be to "grind Dodgers starters down," elevate pitch counts, and get on base, aiming to make any reliever not named Roki Sasaki pitch at least two innings in each of the next three games.

Conversely, the Dodgers need their starting pitchers to continue pitching deep into games, preventing early bullpen use. Crucially, they need their star offensive players like Ohtani, Betts, and Freeman to break out of their postseason slump. The series schedule continues with Game 4 on Tuesday, October 28, and Game 5 on Wednesday, October 29, both at Dodger Stadium. Should the series extend, Games 6 and 7 would return to Toronto on November 1 and 2, respectively, promising more nail-biting baseball.

As the 2025 World Series intensifies, Game 3 is set to be a defining contest. With the series tied and a crucial home-field advantage on the line, every pitch and every swing will matter. Don't miss a moment of the action as these two powerhouses battle for World Series glory!
