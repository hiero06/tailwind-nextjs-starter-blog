## Tom Sandoval Takes Center Stage on America's Got Talent: The Most Extras Promise a \"Bigger Production\"
\n
Reality TV personality Tom Sandoval, widely recognized from *Vanderpump Rules*, is captivating audiences on *America's Got Talent* with his band, The Most Extras. Following an impressive audition, Sandoval is gearing up to deliver an even \"bigger production\" for the live shows, hoping to win over viewers and transcend his past controversies.
\n\n
### Event/Topic Overview
\n
Tom Sandoval and his cover band, The Most Extras, garnered attention earlier this summer by auditioning for *America's Got Talent* Season 20. Their energetic rendition of A-ha’s “Take on Me” impressed the judges, earning them a coveted spot in the highly anticipated live shows, set to commence on August 19, 2025.
\n
The band is among the 44 acts selected by the judges to compete in four weeks of live performances, with only three acts advancing each week based on viewer votes. Sandoval expressed both nervousness and excitement about this new challenge, acknowledging the immense talent surrounding him.
\n\n
### Key Highlights & Standouts
\n
#### Audition Performance: \"Take on Me\"
\n
The Most Extras’ audition performance of A-ha’s “Take on Me” was described as an energetic and elaborate production. While judges Howie Mandel, Sofia Vergara, and Mel B praised the performance, Simon Cowell distinctly critiqued Sandoval’s vocals, stating they \"weren't great,\" though he acknowledged Sandoval's authenticity.
\n
Sandoval took Cowell's feedback \"to heart,\" admitting he could always improve. Despite the criticism, \"Take on Me\" holds deep personal significance for him, as it symbolized a personal triumph: hitting the challenging high note in its original key.
\n
#### Preparing for the Live Shows
\n
For their upcoming live performances, Tom Sandoval has promised a \"grander show\" and a \"more elaborate production,\" and hinted at exploring a different musical genre. The band has been diligently rehearsing new material and practicing extensively to prepare for the increased stakes.
\n
#### Unique Vocal Cord Ritual
\n
To maintain his vocal stamina for performing 20 to 24 songs per show, particularly during back-to-back tour dates, Sandoval has a unique pre-show ritual. He drinks tea with honey, to which he adds melted gummy bears, believing this concoction coats his vocal cords—a method he reportedly learned from Chad Kroeger of Nickelback.
\n\n
### Public & Critical Reaction
\n
Tom Sandoval's appearance on *America's Got Talent* is part of his broader effort to rehabilitate his public image following the highly publicized \"Scandoval\" in 2023, which earned him the title of \"most hated man in America.\" His participation is widely viewed as a strategic move to distance himself from the *Vanderpump Rules* drama and spotlight his musical aspirations.
\n
His prior appearance on *The Traitors* Season 3 received considerable fan support, which he found \"really, really nice and refreshing,\" boosting his confidence. However, facing America’s vote on *AGT* introduces a heightened level of pressure, especially with Simon Cowell's reputation for brutal honesty.
\n\n
### Behind the Scenes / Background
\n
Before *America's Got Talent*, Sandoval established his career over 11 seasons of *Vanderpump Rules*. Following the \"Scandoval\" controversy, he diversified his reality television appearances, competing on *Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test* Season 2 and *House of Villains*. He described *House of Villains* as one of his favorite competition show experiences, and valued the sense of agency he had over his own narrative.
\n
Sandoval also recalled a notable early career highlight: starring in Bon Jovi's 2002 \"Misunderstood\" music video. He fondly recounted the large-scale production, which involved closing down New York City streets for stunts, and the excitement of being in a music video shown on VH1 and TRL, describing it as one of the coolest experiences of his life.
\n
Regarding his personal life, Sandoval recently saw former *Vanderpump Rules* castmate Jax Taylor, suggesting their friendship remains intact, after they were seen attending a screening of *Freakier Friday* together.
\n\n
### Significance & What's Next
\n
Tom Sandoval views *America's Got Talent* as \"definitely the biggest stage\" he has ever been on, marking a significant evolution in his career. His participation represents a crucial turning point in his public perception, as he endeavors to transition from reality TV drama to a serious musical career. While he acknowledges the \"slim chance\" of winning *AGT* given the caliber of talent, he expressed immense happiness for himself and his band should they achieve success.
\n
Looking ahead, Sandoval is eager to continue participating in competition shows, even considering *Survivor* as a future endeavor. Fans can also anticipate his presence at BravoCon in November, and there's a possibility The Most Extras will perform. With ongoing tour dates, Tom Sandoval & The Most Extras are set to continue their musical endeavors, as they strive for enduring success beyond the reality television spotlight.
\n\n
Catch Tom Sandoval & The Most Extras perform on *America’s Got Talent* on NBC, and follow their journey as they aim to impress the nation and redefine their narrative. For more information on the band and upcoming tour dates, visit their official website.
