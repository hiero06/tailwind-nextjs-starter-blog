## Is Lainey Wilson Married? Spotlight on the CMA Host's Fiancé Devlin Hodges Amid Award Show Buzz

As country superstar Lainey Wilson prepares to host the CMA Awards, fan curiosity about her personal life is peaking, alongside anticipation for the show itself. Questions such as "Is Lainey Wilson married?" and "Is Lainey Wilson engaged?" are trending as fans celebrate her romance with former NFL quarterback Devlin "Duck" Hodges. While Wilson and her fiancé are undoubtedly a major point of discussion, the upcoming event is also generating buzz about which other stars will grace—or miss—country music's biggest night.

### CMA Awards: A Night Hosted by Country's Biggest Star

The upcoming CMA Awards, slated for November 19, promise to be a highly anticipated event, with Lainey Wilson at the helm as host. The evening will feature powerhouse performances from country music's biggest names, including Little Big Town, Kelsea Ballerini, Brandi Carlile, and Luke Combs. However, two of the genre's most recognizable figures, Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani, will be notably absent. A source confirmed that the couple plans to watch the ceremony from the comfort of their home this year, despite Blake Shelton's nomination in the Musical Event of the Year category for his collaboration with Post Malone on the hit song “Pour Me a Drink.”

### Behind the Scenes: The Enduring Romance of Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani

While their decision to skip the ceremony has garnered attention, Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani's enduring love story continues to captivate audiences. Married since 2021, the couple first connected during a period of significant personal turmoil for both, meeting as coaches on *The Voice* in 2015. Their transformation from colleagues to soulmates offers a compelling narrative of finding love when it's least expected.

#### A Second Chance at Life

Both artists have openly shared how their relationship served as a lifeline during difficult times. Gwen, who shares three sons with her ex-husband, described the dissolution of her first marriage as a "catastrophe." She shared with an interviewer, “Meeting my husband felt like a second chance at life. Because when my family fell apart... How do you pick yourself up from that? But God put this other person there to love me.” Her words reflect profound gratitude for their unexpected union, which she describes as a miracle.

#### "Gwen Saved My Life"

Blake Shelton has echoed these sentiments, openly sharing how Gwen pulled him from a dark period following his high-profile divorce from Miranda Lambert. In a 2016 interview, he confessed, "I was at rock bottom, in the middle of hell. Gwen saved my life. Who else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician?" He further elaborated on this profound connection, explaining, "We found each other at a very low point. She kept me from going to the absolute bottom... It was like literally falling off a cliff and a hand reached out and caught me is what it feels like." For Blake, the unwavering support Gwen provides, he revealed, was unlike anything he had experienced before, leading him to call it "the greatest feeling ever."

#### From Orange County to Oklahoma

Their connection has also successfully bridged their vastly different backgrounds. Gwen, a Southern California native, has wholeheartedly embraced the country lifestyle. "I grew up in Orange County... our nature was the beach," she explained in 2020. "So to be able to be in Oklahoma and be able to experience a ranch kind of vibe is just something I never ever had, so it's just been really, it's been great, amazing." This merging of their distinct worlds has become a cornerstone of their relationship, demonstrating a genuine and shared life away from the Hollywood spotlight.

### Significance & What's Next

While Blake and Gwen will certainly be missed at the CMAs, their focus remains firmly on their shared personal and professional ventures. The couple is slated to headline a major event in Texas, and Gwen recently released new Christmas music, including the song "Hot Cocoa," inspired by pairings that are "so right together"—much like her relationship with Blake. Their absence from the awards show naturally shifts even more of the spotlight onto host Lainey Wilson and the impressive roster of performers, making it a pivotal night for the current generation of country stars.

As Lainey Wilson confidently steps into her role as host, the buzz surrounding her engagement to Devlin Hodges adds an additional layer of excitement to the evening. While the CMA Awards will primarily celebrate the best in country music, the enduring stories of love—both emerging and well-established—continue to resonate deeply with fans. Be sure to tune in to the CMA Awards to witness Lainey Wilson shine and to catch all the incredible performances lined up for country music's biggest night.
