## Sepsis from a Dog Lick: The Tragic Case of Manjit Sangha and the Dangers of Infection

A routine interaction with a family pet escalated into a life-altering medical emergency for Manjit Sangha, a pharmacy worker who lost all four limbs to sepsis. Her harrowing journey serves as a stark reminder of how quickly a common infection can spiral into a catastrophic health crisis.

Medical experts believe the source of her condition was a seemingly innocuous event: a simple lick from her dog on a small cut or scratch. This rare but devastating occurrence has sparked a vital conversation about the importance of recognizing the early warning signs of sepsis and the potential risks associated with animal bacteria.

### Event Overview: A Weekend That Changed Everything

Last July, Manjit Sangha was living a normal life, working seven days a week between a pharmacy and a distribution center. On a Saturday, she was playing with her dog, exhibiting no signs of illness. By Sunday afternoon, she began to feel unwell, and by Monday evening, she was fighting for her life in a coma at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton.

The speed of her decline was described as "alarming" by her husband, Kam Sangha. Within 24 hours of experiencing the first symptoms, Manjit was unconscious with cold feet, blue lips, and severe difficulty breathing. Her body had entered a state of septic shock, a condition where the immune system overreacts to an infection and begins attacking its own organs and tissues.

Manjit spent a total of 32 weeks in the hospital, during which time she faced profound medical challenges. While in intensive care, her heart stopped six times, requiring immediate resuscitation. To save her life, surgeons had to perform a quadruple amputation, removing both of her legs below the knee and both of her hands. She also lost her spleen and battled secondary complications, including pneumonia and gallstones.

### Key Highlights: A Battle for Survival

Manjit Sangha's story is marked by her incredible resilience and the medical milestones she reached against all odds. Her recovery is considered nothing short of a miracle by the medical staff who treated her at Russells Hall Hospital and Moseley Hall Hospital.

#### The Lethal Speed of Sepsis

One of the most significant aspects of this case is the rapid progression of the disease. Her husband Kam noted the jarring transition from a normal weekend to a life-support situation. "One minute on a Saturday she's playing with the dog, Sunday she's gone to work, Monday night she's in a coma," he shared. This case dramatically underscores that sepsis is a medical emergency where every second counts, and delayed treatment can lead to permanent disability or death.

#### Survival Against Six Cardiac Arrests

While in the intensive care unit at New Cross Hospital, Manjit’s heart stopped on six separate occasions. Each time, medical teams were able to revive her, attesting to her remarkable physical resilience and the dedication of her healthcare providers. Her husband noted that despite doctors believing she would not survive, she defied expectations daily throughout her 32-week ordeal.

#### The Quadruple Amputation and Recovery

As the sepsis spread, the blood flow to Manjit's extremities was compromised, necessitating the amputation of both hands and both legs below the knee. In addition to these life-altering surgeries, she also had her spleen removed. Despite the loss of her limbs, Manjit has maintained a positive outlook, stating that she is determined to walk again and eventually return to her professional life.

### Public & Critical Reaction: Awareness and Support

The public reaction to Manjit’s story has been one of overwhelming sympathy and a collective push for greater awareness of sepsis symptoms. Since her story was shared, there has been a significant surge in interest regarding the "sepsis from dog lick" phenomenon, with many pet owners seeking information on how to interact safely with their animals.

A GoFundMe page and fundraising efforts at Screwfix, where both Manjit and her husband worked, have raised over £24,000 (€27,000). These funds are intended to help provide Manjit with advanced prosthetics, including potentially robotic hands, which can cost tens of thousands of pounds. The community support has been a pillar for the family, especially as Kam Sangha took seven months off work to act as a full-time support system for his wife.

Medical experts and public health organizations, such as the UK Sepsis Trust and the Irish Sepsis Foundation, have used this case to reiterate the severity of the condition. With an estimated 50,000 sepsis-related deaths in the UK and 3,000 in Ireland each year, health officials are urging the public to take symptoms like extreme shivering, mottled skin, and a lack of urination seriously.

### Behind the Scenes: The Science of Sepsis and Animal Bacteria

While a dog lick may seem harmless, the mouth of a canine contains a variety of bacteria that can be dangerous if they enter the human bloodstream through an open wound. In a similar case involving 83-year-old June Baxter, an inquest found that she died from septic shock after a dog licked a cut on her leg. Tests in that case revealed the presence of *Pasteurella multocida*, a bacterium commonly found in the mouths of cats and dogs.

When these bacteria enter the bloodstream of a person with a compromised immune system, or even a healthy individual, through a deep enough cut, the body can trigger a massive inflammatory response. This response causes blood vessels to leak and small clots to form, which blocks oxygen from reaching vital organs. In Manjit's case, this led to the failure of her limbs and the necessity for amputation to stop the spread of dead tissue.

The medical implications of this story emphasize that sepsis "could happen to anybody," as Manjit herself warned. It is not just the result of major injuries but can stem from something as "innocuous" as a small scratch that most people might ignore.

### Significance & What's Next: A New Journey

The significance of Manjit Sangha’s story lies in her transition from a victim of a rare medical tragedy to an advocate for sepsis awareness. By sharing the graphic and painful details of her experience, she hopes to prevent others from enduring the same ordeal. Her case has become a primary example used by health advocates to explain the "FAST" signs of sepsis: Fever, Altered mental status, Systemic illness, and Tissue perfusion issues.

Looking forward, Manjit is focused on her rehabilitation at home in Penn, near the Wolverhampton and Staffordshire border. Her immediate goal is to master the use of prosthetic limbs. "I’ve sat down in my chair and my bed enough. It’s time to walk now," she told the BBC. Her determination to return to work and regain her independence serves as an inspiration to other amputees and sepsis survivors worldwide.

The family also plans to continue their fundraising efforts, as the cost of lifelong care and advanced bionic technology remains high. As she moves into this next chapter, her story remains a powerful testament to the human spirit and a cautionary tale for pet lovers everywhere.

In conclusion, while the bond between humans and their pets is usually beneficial, Manjit Sangha's experience highlights the rare but real risks of sepsis from dog licks. By staying informed about the symptoms of sepsis—such as cold extremities, blue lips, and rapid decline—you can act quickly to save lives. To support Manjit's journey or to learn more about the early signs of infection, stay connected with local health resources and sepsis advocacy groups.
