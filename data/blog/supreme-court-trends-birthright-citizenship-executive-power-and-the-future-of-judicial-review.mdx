## Supreme Court Trends: Birthright Citizenship, Executive Power, and the Future of Judicial Review

The Supreme Court's recent term has revealed significant trends regarding birthright citizenship, the scope of executive power, and the role of judicial review. With key rulings shaping the landscape of American law, understanding these trends is crucial for navigating the evolving legal and political climate.

### Quick Context

The Supreme Court's term ending in June 2025 showcased a series of pivotal decisions that have sparked intense debate and legal challenges. A recurring theme throughout these rulings has been the balance of power between the executive and judicial branches, particularly concerning the implementation of presidential policies and the extent to which federal judges can intervene.

#### Surprising Fact: The Supreme Court's emergency docket was packed with appeals from the Trump administration, sometimes weighing in almost once a week.

The implications of these decisions resonate deeply across various sectors, from immigration and healthcare to education and technology. The court's stance on nationwide injunctions, birthright citizenship, and LGBTQ+ rights has set the stage for future legal battles and policy shifts.

#### Key Statistic: The Supreme Court preserved a key part of the Affordable Care Act’s preventive health care coverage requirements, affecting some 150 million Americans.

Understanding the context behind these rulings requires delving into the specific cases and the legal arguments presented. The Supreme Court's decisions often hinge on interpretations of the Constitution and existing laws, reflecting the justices' differing judicial philosophies and their approaches to balancing individual rights with governmental authority.

#### Surprising Fact: Justice Amy Coney Barrett responded to Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s “startling line of attack” by accusing her of decrying an imperial executive while embracing an imperial judiciary.

### What You Need to Know

Several critical themes emerged from the Supreme Court's recent term, providing insight into the court's current priorities and legal trajectory. These include rulings on birthright citizenship, executive power, healthcare, education, and technology regulation.

#### Core Development: Supreme Court Limits Nationwide Injunctions

One of the most significant developments was the Supreme Court's decision to limit the authority of individual judges to issue nationwide injunctions. This ruling stemmed from President Trump's efforts to end birthright citizenship, a policy that had faced numerous legal challenges. The court's decision clarified that individual district judges likely exceeded their powers by issuing nationwide injunctions, which had blocked several of Trump's policies on immigration, diversity, and federal employee firings.

This limitation on nationwide injunctions is a victory for the executive branch, as it reduces the ability of lower courts to unilaterally halt presidential policies. However, the court left open the possibility that broad relief could still be sought through class-action lawsuits, suggesting that legal challenges to executive actions will continue.

#### Core Development: The Birthright Citizenship Debate

The Supreme Court's rulings indirectly addressed the contentious issue of birthright citizenship. Under President Trump’s plan, birthright citizenship would be limited to those who have at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. This proposal challenges the widely accepted understanding of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to anyone born in the U.S., with few exceptions.

While the Supreme Court did not rule directly on the constitutionality of Trump’s executive order seeking to end automatic citizenship, the decision to limit nationwide injunctions removes a significant roadblock. It allows the administration to proceed with the policy, potentially leading to further legal challenges and a more definitive ruling on the scope of the 14th Amendment.

#### Core Development: Preserving Obamacare and Preventive Healthcare

The Supreme Court also preserved a key part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, specifically the preventive health care coverage requirements. The court rejected a challenge from Christian employers who argued that the process for deciding which health care services must be fully covered by private insurance was unconstitutional.

The 6-3 ruling affirmed that the ACA's preventive health care coverage requirements would remain in place, impacting approximately 150 million Americans. This decision ensures that essential health services, such as vaccinations and screenings, continue to be accessible without cost-sharing.

#### Core Development: Education and LGBTQ+ Rights

In a case involving Maryland parents with religious objections, the Supreme Court ruled that these parents could pull their children from public school lessons using LGBTQ storybooks. The court reversed lower-court rulings, suggesting that schools could not require elementary school children to sit through lessons involving the books if parents expressed religious objections.

This decision reflects the court’s emphasis on religious freedom and parental rights in education. While not a final ruling, it signals a potential shift in how schools address sensitive topics and accommodate diverse beliefs.

#### Core Development: Technology and Regulatory Fees

The Supreme Court upheld the fee added to phone bills to subsidize phone and internet services in schools, libraries, and rural areas. The justices reversed an appeals court ruling that had struck down the Universal Service Fund, a charge that has been added to phone bills for nearly 30 years. This decision ensures the continuation of subsidized services that benefit millions of Americans, particularly in underserved communities.

#### Core Development: Online Content and Age Verification

The Supreme Court also upheld a Texas law aimed at blocking children under 18 from seeing online pornography. This ruling supports state efforts to regulate online content and protect minors from harmful material. With nearly half of all states having passed similar age verification laws, this decision provides a legal framework for further regulation of online content.

### Why This Matters (Implications)

The Supreme Court's recent decisions have profound implications for the balance of power, individual rights, and regulatory frameworks. These rulings are not merely legal technicalities; they directly affect the lives of millions and shape the direction of American society. The court's willingness to curb the power of individual judges to issue nationwide injunctions signals a broader shift toward executive authority. This could lead to more rapid implementation of presidential policies without the immediate check of judicial intervention.

The decisions also highlight the ongoing tensions between religious freedom and LGBTQ+ rights, between governmental authority and individual liberties. These areas are likely to remain focal points of legal and political contention in the years to come. Furthermore, the upholding of the Universal Service Fund and the Texas law aimed at blocking children from online pornography underscore the government's role in ensuring equitable access to essential services and protecting vulnerable populations in the digital age.

### Potential Impact & Future Outlook

In the short term, the Supreme Court's rulings are expected to embolden the executive branch to pursue policies that have been previously blocked or challenged. The limitation on nationwide injunctions allows the Trump administration to move forward with policies such as restrictions on birthright citizenship and changes to immigration enforcement.

The long-term implications are far-reaching. The composition of the Supreme Court, with its conservative majority, suggests a sustained emphasis on executive power and a more cautious approach to judicial intervention. Future cases involving individual rights, regulatory authority, and the balance of powers are likely to be decided with these trends in mind.

The ongoing debates surrounding birthright citizenship, LGBTQ+ rights, and access to healthcare will continue to shape the legal landscape. As new challenges arise, the Supreme Court's interpretations of the Constitution and existing laws will play a pivotal role in determining the future of American society.

### Conclusion

The Supreme Court's recent term has underscored critical trends related to executive power, judicial review, and individual rights. From limiting nationwide injunctions to addressing birthright citizenship and LGBTQ+ rights, the court's decisions have set the stage for future legal and political battles. Stay updated on these developments to better understand the evolving landscape of American law and its impact on your life.
