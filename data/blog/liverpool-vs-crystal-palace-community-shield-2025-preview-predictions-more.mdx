### Liverpool could suffer unwanted first in Crystal Palace Community Shield clash after Newcastle Wembley woes

Liverpool are at risk of suffering an unwanted club first when they take on Crystal Palace in Sunday's Community Shield showdown at Wembley Stadium,The Reds are back in the traditional English football curtain-raiser for the first time in three years courtesy of their Premier League triumph in 2024-25, earning a date with Palace thanks to the Eagles' stunning FA Cup final success over Manchester City.

Arne Slot's men have built up a head of steam going into the capital clash, winning five of their six friendlies in the pre-season period, including each of their last three.

A 4-2 loss to AC Milan was the only blot on the notebook for the English champions, who secured three straight wins over Yokohama F. Marinos and Athletic Bilbao (twice) to close out their preparatory period.

The Reds do not have fond memories of their most recent trip to Wembley, where they were deservedly beaten by Newcastle United in the final of the EFL Cup, leaving them 90 minutes away from an unwanted fate.

### Liverpool at risk of suffering second Wembley loss in 2025

Should Liverpool fall to defeat on Sunday, it would mark the first time in their history that they have lost two separate games at Wembley in a single calendar year.

Meanwhile, Palace come into the Community Shield with a pleasing record of four victories from their last six matches at the national stadium, although they lost as recently as 2022 to Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-finals.

The Eagles will be making their debut in the Community Shield this weekend, whereas Liverpool have already contested 24 English Super Cup games, the joint second-most alongside Arsenal and only behind Manchester United's 31.

The Reds have triumphed 16 times - including shared successes - and another win would also draw them level with Arsenal on 17 victories and take them to within four of record holders Man United (21).

### What could Liverpool's lineup look like against Palace?

Defensive concerns have arisen for Liverpool ahead of the Community Shield, as Joe Gomez is definitely missing with an Achilles injury, while Virgil van Dijk (illness) and Conor Bradley (muscle) have been struggling recently too.

Alisson Becker has been dealing with a personal issue of late, so Giorgi Mamardashvili could very well be protected by a makeshift defence of Ibrahima Konate and Wataru Endo, flanked by new signings Milos Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong.

New signings Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike ought to make their full competitive debuts for Liverpool in attack, while Rio Ngumoha may have earned the right to play alongside the duo and Mohamed Salah, but Cody Gakpo is a more senior option.
