## NFL Training Camp Battles 2025: Analyzing Key Position Competitions Across All 32 Teams

NFL training camps are in full swing, and the competition is fierce as teams prepare for the 2025 season. From quarterback controversies to wide receiver auditions, every team has key position battles to watch as players fight for roster spots and starting roles.

### Event/Topic Overview

NFL Nation reporters are on the ground at training camps across the league, providing daily observations as teams evaluate their talent. A major focus during training camp is the intense competition for positions on the depth chart. Players are making their cases to be included on the final 53-man rosters, and coaches are looking for clarity on who will start and who will provide crucial backup support.

Several teams have particularly intriguing battles unfolding. The Los Angeles Rams are seeking their third receiving option, while the Cleveland Browns, Indianapolis Colts, and New Orleans Saints are still deciding on their starting quarterbacks for Week 1. These competitions and many others will shape the landscape of the upcoming NFL season.

### Key Highlights & Standouts

Across the league, several position battles are drawing significant attention. Here's a breakdown of some of the most compelling competitions:

#### AFC East: Buffalo Bills - Backup Quarterback

The Buffalo Bills are evaluating who will back up Josh Allen. While General Manager Brandon Beane has expressed confidence in Mitchell Trubisky, he and Mike White are splitting second-team reps. Preseason games will be crucial in determining the winner.

#### AFC East: Miami Dolphins - Cornerback

The Miami Dolphins have significant turnover at cornerback after releasing or trading their starters from last season and losing Kader Kohou to injury. Recent signings like Cornell Armstrong, Jack Jones, and Mike Hilton will compete with Cam Smith, Storm Duck, Kendall Sheffield, and Ethan Bonner for playing time.

#### AFC East: New England Patriots - Wide Receiver

The New England Patriots' wide receiver competition is wide open. Stefon Diggs, Kayshon Boutte, and DeMario Douglas have been in the top group, but veterans like Kendrick Bourne and Kyle Williams, along with draft picks Ja'Lynn Polk and Javon Baker, are also making plays. With potentially six or seven roster spots available, competition is intense.

#### AFC East: New York Jets - Center

The New York Jets have an open competition at center between incumbent Joe Tippmann and former Packers starter Josh Myers. Myers' experience and familiarity with quarterback Justin Fields, his former college teammate, give him an advantage.

#### AFC North: Baltimore Ravens - Kicker

The Baltimore Ravens are searching for a new kicker after releasing Justin Tucker. Rookies Tyler Loop and John Hoyland are battling for the job, with the Ravens hoping to settle on a winner around the preseason finale.

#### AFC North: Cleveland Browns - Quarterback

The Cleveland Browns opened camp with a four-way quarterback competition, but Kenny Pickett's hamstring injury has seemingly paved the way for Joe Flacco to lead the starting offense and stake his claim to be the starter. Opportunities have opened for rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders as well.

#### AFC North: Pittsburgh Steelers - No. 2 Wide Receiver

After trading away George Pickens, the Pittsburgh Steelers are looking for a No. 2 receiver to play alongside DK Metcalf. Calvin Austin III, Robert Woods, Scotty Miller, and Roman Wilson are all in contention.

#### AFC South: Houston Texans - Offensive Tackle

The Houston Texans are evaluating both tackle spots, with rookie Aireontae Ersery competing with Cam Robinson and Blake Fisher. Protecting quarterback C.J. Stroud is a top priority after he was sacked 52 times last season.

#### AFC South: Indianapolis Colts - Quarterback

The Indianapolis Colts are giving Anthony Richardson Sr. and Daniel Jones an equal shot at the starting quarterback job. Coach Shane Steichen is willing to take his time making a decision, so this one could linger until the end of the preseason.

#### AFC South: Tennessee Titans - Tight End

Chig Okonkwo is the incumbent tight end for the Tennessee Titans, but rookie Gunnar Helm is pushing for the spot. Both players have caught quarterback Cameron Ward's attention, and the Titans may utilize two-tight-end sets.

#### AFC West: Denver Broncos - Running Back

The Denver Broncos are evaluating their running back situation to determine who will get the ball in the most situations. J.K. Dobbins has spent time with the starters, but rookie RJ Harvey has impressed with his vision and quickness.

#### AFC West: Kansas City Chiefs - Left Guard

With rookie Josh Simmons at left tackle, the Kansas City Chiefs are focused on finding a starting left guard. Kingsley Suamataia and Jaylon Moore are the top contenders, and their preseason performance will likely determine the winner.

#### AFC West: Los Angeles Chargers - Center

The Los Angeles Chargers are looking to improve their interior offensive line, with a three-person battle at center between Bradley Bozeman, Zion Johnson, and Andre James.

#### NFC East: Dallas Cowboys - Running Back

The Dallas Cowboys are giving equal looks to Javonte Williams and Miles Sanders at running back. Williams might have an edge as a pass-catcher, while Sanders might be better suited for short-yardage situations.

#### NFC East: New York Giants - Second Cornerback

The New York Giants have a competition at the second cornerback spot between Deonte Banks and Cor'Dale Flott. They are alternating days with the first-team defense at training camp.

#### NFC East: Washington Commanders - Right Tackle

The Washington Commanders drafted Josh Conerly Jr. in the first round, but he's rotating first-team snaps with veteran Andrew Wylie. The team will likely give Conerly time to develop before potentially forcing him into the starting lineup.

#### NFC North: Chicago Bears - Left Tackle

The Chicago Bears are evaluating Braxton Jones, Kiran Amegadjie, and rookie Ozzy Trapilo at left tackle to protect quarterback Caleb Williamsâ€™ blindside.

#### NFC North: Detroit Lions - Center

The Detroit Lions are looking to replace Frank Ragnow at center, with Graham Glasgow appearing to have the inside track on the starting job. Second-round pick Tate Ratledge is also in the mix.

#### NFC North: Green Bay Packers - Wide Receiver

With Christian Watson out to start the season, the Green Bay Packers are determining their wide receiver pecking order. Rookie Matthew Golden has impressed in camp, while Jayden Reed, Romeo Doubs, and Tucker Kraft are also vying for Jordan Love's attention.

#### NFC South: Atlanta Falcons - Safety

The Atlanta Falcons have Jessie Bates III locked in at one safety spot, with Jordan Fuller and rookie Xavier Watts competing for the other starting role.

#### NFC South: Carolina Panthers - Center

Austin Corbett and Cade Mays are alternating days working with the first-team offense for the Carolina Panthers. Mays caught the eye of the coaching staff last season when he started eight of the final nine games and allowed only 10 QB pressures.

#### NFC West: Arizona Cardinals - Outside Linebacker

The Arizona Cardinals committed to improving their pass rush and are evaluating Zaven Collins, Jordan Burch, and others to start opposite Josh Sweat at outside linebacker.

#### NFC West: Los Angeles Rams - No. 3 Wide Receiver

The Los Angeles Rams are searching for a No. 3 receiver behind Puka Nacua and Davante Adams, with Tutu Atwell, Jordan Whittington, and Xavier Smith competing for the role.

#### NFC West: Seattle Seahawks - Right Guard

The Seattle Seahawks are evaluating Anthony Bradford, Christian Haynes, and Jalen Sundell at right guard, a crucial position for their offensive line.

### Significance & What's Next

These training camp battles are crucial for teams as they finalize their rosters and prepare for the upcoming season. The decisions made in the coming weeks will have a significant impact on team performance and could shape the playoff landscape.
