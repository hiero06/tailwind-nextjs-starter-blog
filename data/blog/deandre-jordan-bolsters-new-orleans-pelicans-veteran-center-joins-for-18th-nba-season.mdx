## DeAndre Jordan Bolsters New Orleans Pelicans: Veteran Center Joins for 18th NBA Season

The New Orleans Pelicans have made a significant move to strengthen their front line, signing veteran center DeAndre Jordan to a one-year, $3.6 million contract. This strategic addition aims to provide much-needed experience and depth to a young Pelicans roster, as announced by ESPN and confirmed by the team.

### Event/Topic Overview

Free agent center DeAndre Jordan officially joined the New Orleans Pelicans on a one-year, $3.6 million contract. The announcement came on Friday, October 25, 2025, with reports from The Athletic's Shams Charania and subsequent confirmation from the Pelicans, who did not immediately disclose terms.

The acquisition addresses an urgent need for the Pelicans, highlighted by their season-opening loss to the Memphis Grizzlies, where they struggled against Jaren Jackson Jr.'s dominant six-block performance. With star big man Zion Williamson's history of missing games and current centers like second-year player Yves Missi (questionable with an ankle injury) and rookies Derik Queen and Hunter Dickinson, an experienced presence was crucial. This imbalance further emphasized the need for robust center play.

### Key Highlights & Standouts

DeAndre Jordan, at 37 years old and entering his 18th NBA season, brings a wealth of experience and specific skills that the Pelicans can utilize, even with his "Lob City" days behind him.

#### Veteran Leadership and Championship Pedigree

Jordan is a one-time All-NBA big man and a 2023 champion with the Denver Nuggets, where he spent the last three seasons. His extensive experience in the league and his role as a veteran leader in Denver’s locker room are precisely what the Pelicans could use to stabilize their promising young core.

#### Front-Line Depth and Rim Presence

While his minutes have decreased over the past five seasons, Jordan remains an effective presence close to the basket. He still provides a valuable lob threat and can finish with dunks, offering a looming target at the rim for the second unit's playmakers.

#### Elite Longevity and Efficiency

Jordan's 1,111 career games played place him in elite company, with fewer than two percent of all NBA players playing for such an extended period. He is also the NBA's all-time leader in field goal percentage at 67.4%, a testament to his efficient finishing around the rim throughout his career.

#### Mentorship for Young Talent

Beyond his on-court contributions, Jordan's presence is expected to be invaluable as a mentor for the Pelicans’ young centers, such as second-year player Yves Missi and rookies Derik Queen and Hunter Dickinson. His vast experience can help them navigate the challenges of an NBA career, including injury concerns, potentially even benefiting Zion Williamson.

### Public & Critical Reaction

The signing of DeAndre Jordan has been largely viewed as a clear effort by the Pelicans to rectify immediate roster deficiencies. The initial reports quickly generated buzz, highlighting Jordan's notable longevity and championship background.

Critics and analysts acknowledge that while Jordan is no longer the explosive force of his Clippers days, his veteran presence and specific skill set are a smart, low-cost investment for New Orleans. The move is seen as a necessary step to provide an established center against formidable opponents and to bring a crucial element of leadership to a developing locker room.

### Behind the Scenes / Background

The impetus for this signing became strikingly clear after the Pelicans' season-opening defeat to the Memphis Grizzlies. The lack of an established center to counter the likes of Jaren Jackson Jr. was glaring, with the team relying on a trio of young centers, including two rookies, and facing injuries to key front-court players.

Jordan's immediate availability was key; he was with the Pelicans on Friday morning and expected to be available for their game against the San Antonio Spurs. His previous role with the Denver Nuggets, where he was relied upon as a veteran leader and often proved to be a reliable option at backup center—playing 56 games last season—showcases his continued utility in a specific role. This familiarity with high-level systems could aid in smoother on-court integration for the Pelicans' second unit.

### Significance & What's Next

The signing of DeAndre Jordan is significant for the New Orleans Pelicans on multiple fronts. It immediately shores up their front-line depth, providing a seasoned big man who can contribute defensively and as a lob threat, particularly valuable given Zion Williamson's injury history and the current state of the center rotation.

More broadly, Jordan’s arrival brings invaluable poise and leadership to a talented but young locker room. While he may not stretch the team’s ceiling in terms of pure athleticism, his extensive experience and championship mentality are integral in establishing a harmonious system and mentoring developing players like Derik Queen. The Pelicans, with talents such as Williamson, Trey Murphy, and Herbert Jones, are in a period of transition, and Jordan’s presence is expected to be a big help in achieving their season goals. His integration into the team will likely be gradual, considering his physical limitations at 37, but his impact on the team's cohesion and development could be profound.

DeAndre Jordan’s arrival in New Orleans marks an exciting new chapter for the veteran center and a strategic enhancement for the Pelicans. His experience and leadership will be vital for a team looking to contend in a tough Western Conference. Don’t miss a moment of the action as the Pelicans integrate their new veteran into the squad and push towards a successful season!
