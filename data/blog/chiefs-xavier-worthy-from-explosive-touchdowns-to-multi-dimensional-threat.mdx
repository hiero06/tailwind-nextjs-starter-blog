Following a Super Bowl where Worthy scored a long touchdown, coaches emphasized the need for him to develop into a more versatile player, capable of running multiple routes and establishing a unique identity within the offense.

#### Trent McDuffie Competition

Worthy actively seeks out practice reps against Trent McDuffie, considered one of the best cornerbacks in the NFL. Passing game coordinator Joe Bleymaier noted that this competition helps Worthy "sharpen his fastball," refining his primary skills and developing complementary moves.

#### Rashee Rice Comparison
