## Reveille Revealed: The Unforgettable Story of the Texas A&M Mascot

At the heart of Texas A&M's legendary traditions stands a figure beloved by all Aggies: Reveille, the beautiful rough collie known as the "First Lady of Aggieland." More than just a mascot, Reveille is a living symbol of the university's spirit, rich history, and fierce rivalries. Recent events surrounding the historic Lone Star Showdown have once again placed the Texas A&M mascot and its cherished traditions in the national spotlight, weaving together pageantry with passionate contention.

### Event Overview

As the iconic Lone Star Showdown returned to Austin, Texas A&M brought a cherished tradition back to the city for the first time since 2010. In a powerful display of school pride, the Texas A&M Corps of Cadets executed a grand march down South Congress Avenue ahead of the game against the Texas Longhorns. This impressive procession featured over 2,400 members of the Corps, the celebrated Fightin’ Texas Aggie Band, the Parsons Mounted Cavalry, and, of course, the university's esteemed mascot, Reveille X. The march commenced at 1 p.m., proceeding past a reviewing stand before concluding near West 11th Street, reviving a custom dormant for over a decade.

However, the celebration was met with a significant dose of rivalry drama. In a move that sparked heated debate across social media, the University of Texas reportedly decided not to permit Reveille X on the sidelines of Campbell-Williams Field at Royal-Memorial Stadium. This decision was widely interpreted as a direct response to the previous year's game in College Station, where Texas's mascot, Bevo, was not allowed on the sideline at Kyle Field due to ongoing stadium renovations. The mascot standoff added another layer of intensity to one of college football's most storied rivalries.

### Key Highlights & Standouts

The events surrounding the Texas A&M mascot at the Lone Star Showdown were filled with memorable moments, ranging from grand displays of tradition to spirited rivalry squabbles that captured the attention of fans everywhere.

#### Reveille X: The First Lady of Aggieland

Reveille X, a stunning rough collie, holds a revered position within the Texas A&M community. As the official Texas A&M mascot, she is affectionately known as the "First Lady of Aggieland." Her presence at university events, especially alongside the Corps of Cadets, embodies the spirit and pride of the Aggies, making her a central figure in the university's identity and a beloved icon for students and alumni alike.

#### A Tradition Renewed: The Corps of Cadets March

The march through Austin was a monumental event, marking the return of a beloved tradition after a long hiatus. The sight of over 2,400 cadets, the thundering performance of the Fightin’ Texas Aggie Band, and the regal presence of Reveille X created an unforgettable spectacle on South Congress Avenue. This procession was more than just a pre-game parade; it was a powerful statement of the university's deep military roots and its commitment to upholding its most cherished traditions for a new generation of fans and rivals to witness.

#### The Sideline Standoff: A Mascot Controversy

The decision to bar Reveille X from the field became a major talking point. Texas's move was a clear "return the favor" after their own mascot, Bevo, was denied sideline access the year prior. This tit-for-tat exchange highlighted the passionate and often petty nature of the rivalry, transforming the mascots from simple symbols of school spirit into pawns in a larger game of one-upmanship between the two powerhouse Texas universities.

### Public & Critical Reaction

The news that Reveille would not be permitted on the field ignited a firestorm of online reactions from both sides of the rivalry. Longhorn fans were quick to taunt their Aggie counterparts, pointing out the perceived hypocrisy and fairness of the situation. One user wrote, "Bevo wasn’t allowed at Kyle Field last year. Reveille is ugly anyways." Another chimed in with, "It's only fair... What did you expect after not allowing Texas to bring Bevo last year? Duhhhh." Many Longhorn supporters felt the decision was justified, with one stating, "You claim you don’t have or can’t make room for Bevo last year. So we doing the same."

Meanwhile, Aggie fans expressed their disappointment and frustration over the slight against their beloved mascot. Many felt the comparison between the two mascots was unfair, with one fan simply tweeting, "BEVO ≠ REVEILLE." Others pleaded for a change of heart, with comments like, "Low blow, Puppet (TU)… Let Reveille Attend!!!" and a straightforward "Let her on the field." The emotional response from the Aggie faithful demonstrated just how deeply Reveille is woven into the fabric of the university's culture and pride.

### Behind the Scenes / Background

To understand the passion surrounding the Texas A&M mascot, one must look at the deep-rooted traditions she represents. The Corps of Cadets, who serve as Reveille's official guardians, dates its origins to the university's establishment in 1876. Considered the "Keepers of The Spirit and the Guardians of Tradition," the Corps plays a pivotal role in upholding the unique culture of Texas A&M. This military-based leadership program instills skills applicable far beyond the football field, making its members central figures in university life.

Another core tradition is the famous "Gig 'Em" saying, often accompanied by a thumbs-up gesture. This phrase originated in 1930 during a yell practice before a game against the TCU Horned Frogs. P.L. “Pinkie” Downs, a member of the Texas A&M Board of Regents, famously asked the crowd, “What are we going to do to those horned frogs?” He answered his own question by shouting, “Gig ’em, Aggies!” The "gig" refers to a pronged spear used for hunting frogs, and the phrase, along with the thumbs-up sign, quickly caught on. What started as a rally cry against a specific opponent has since become the universal expression of optimism and support for all Aggie teams.

### Significance & What's Next

The events at the Lone Star Showdown underscore the profound cultural significance of the Texas A&M mascot and its associated traditions. The revival of the Corps of Cadets march in Austin signifies a renewed commitment to showcasing Aggie pride on rival territory, while the sideline controversy proves that the rivalry's passion is as fierce as ever. These traditions are not just historical footnotes; they are living, breathing elements of the university's identity that continue to shape its present and future. As the Lone Star Showdown continues, fans can expect these traditions to play an even larger role, fueling the excitement and animosity that make this one of college football's most compelling matchups.

The story of Reveille, the Corps, and the "Gig 'Em" spirit is a testament to the enduring power of tradition in sports. As the rivalry with Texas continues to evolve, the actions and reactions surrounding these cherished symbols will undoubtedly write the next chapter in this historic saga. For all the latest on this legendary rivalry, follow the Lone Star Showdown and witness how tradition continues to define the heart of Texas college football.
