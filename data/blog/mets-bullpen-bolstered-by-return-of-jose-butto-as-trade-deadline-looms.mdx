## Mets Bullpen Bolstered by Return of José Buttó as Trade Deadline Looms

The New York Mets are getting a much-needed boost to their bullpen with the return of José Buttó from illness. As the trade deadline approaches, the team looks to solidify its relief options for a strong finish to the season.

### Event/Topic Overview

José Buttó made his return to the Mets on Wednesday, July 23, 2025, in a game against the Angels at Citi Field. Buttó had been sidelined due to illness since July 1. The Mets are actively seeking to upgrade their bullpen as the July 31 trade deadline approaches.

### Key Highlights & Standouts

The Mets are strategically reinforcing their bullpen as key pieces return from injury and illness, complementing the team's ongoing efforts to improve their roster through potential trades.

#### Buttó's Return

José Buttó’s final line wasn’t great for the Mets on Wednesday, allowing two earned runs on three hits over two-thirds of an inning in the 6-3 victory over the Angels. Despite the numbers, manager Carlos Mendoza was pleased with Buttó's performance. “With Buttó, I liked the velocity, and he threw strikes,” Mendoza said. “In general, I didn’t see big misses or the velo wasn’t there, it just didn’t go his way today.” Buttó has been a significant contributor this season, owning a 2.84 ERA in 32 appearances.

#### Raley's Resurgence

Brooks Raley, recently back from Tommy John surgery rehab, played a crucial role in the game against the Angels. He secured the final out in the seventh inning and pitched two-thirds of the eighth. Mendoza highlighted Raley's importance: “We are asking a lot out of him right out of the gate. Ideally, I didn’t want to push him to [29] pitches, but that is where we were today.”

#### Stearns' Trade Deadline Focus

President of baseball operations David Stearns has identified the bullpen as a primary area of focus as the July 31 trade deadline approaches. The Mets are actively exploring options to add depth and talent to their relief corps.

#### Marte's Impact

Starling Marte, in his first appearance since returning from the IL, had a strong performance, going 2-for-4 with a double. Marte has been on a hot streak, hitting 24-for-67 (.358) with an .875 OPS over his past 18 games.

### Public & Critical Reaction

Mets fans and analysts alike are closely watching the team's bullpen situation, recognizing its importance for a successful season. The return of Buttó and Raley has been met with optimism, but there's also an understanding that further reinforcements are needed.

### Behind the Scenes / Background

The Mets' management is strategically balancing the return of key players from injury with the pursuit of external talent via trades. The team optioned Justin Garza to Triple-A Syracuse to make room for Buttó, illustrating the ongoing roster adjustments. Paul Blackburn, rehabbing from a shoulder impingement, is scheduled for another minor league start before being considered for a return.

### Significance & What's Next

The strengthening of the Mets bullpen is vital as they aim to compete for a playoff spot. José Buttó's role as rotation insurance and long relief provides valuable depth, while Raley’s high-leverage experience is crucial in tight games. The upcoming trade deadline will be pivotal in determining the final composition of the Mets bullpen, with David Stearns actively seeking upgrades.

Looking ahead, the Mets have a series of games scheduled, including matchups against the San Francisco Giants from July 25-27, 2025, and a game against the San Diego Padres on July 28, 2025. These games will provide opportunities for the revamped bullpen to demonstrate its effectiveness.
