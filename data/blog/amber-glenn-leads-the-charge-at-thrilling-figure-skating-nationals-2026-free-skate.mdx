## Amber Glenn Leads the Charge at Thrilling Figure Skating Nationals 2026 Free Skate

The 2026 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in St. Louis reached a crescendo of excitement as the women and pairs took to the ice for their highly anticipated free skate programs. With the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano Cortina on the horizon, every jump, spin, and intricate footwork sequence served as a critical audition for a coveted spot on Team USA.

### Event Overview: U.S. Figure Skating Championships Day 3

Day three of the 2026 U.S. Figure Skating Championships, held at the Enterprise Center in St. Louis, Missouri, featured intense free skate sessions for both pairs and women. Following a dazzling short program round, athletes were determined to deliver their best performances to secure national titles and impress the Olympic selection committee.

The evening session, which included the top groups for both categories, was broadcast live on NBC and available for streaming in its entirety on Peacock. This allowed fans across the nation to witness the high-stakes competition as contenders vied for supremacy.

The schedule saw Pairs free skate Groups 2 and 3 take the ice from 7:36 p.m. ET, followed by the Women's free skate Groups 2 and 3 beginning at 9:08 p.m. ET. The evening culminated in the most anticipated women's performances of the night.

### Key Highlights & Standouts

The competition was fierce, with several athletes delivering unforgettable performances that captivated judges and audiences alike. The top contenders in the women's field—Amber Glenn, Alysa Liu, and Isabeau Levito—continued to showcase their dominance.

#### Amber Glenn's Bid for a Three-Peat

Amber Glenn entered the free skate in a commanding first place after her powerful short program performance. She was firmly on track to potentially win her third consecutive U.S. title, a testament to her consistency and strength on the ice. Her highly anticipated free skate was scheduled for 10:43 p.m. ET, closing out the women's event.

#### Alysa Liu Unveils Bold Lady Gaga-Inspired Free Skate

Reigning world champion Alysa Liu brought renewed energy to the ice with her revamped Lady Gaga medley free skate. Scheduled to perform at 10:35 p.m. ET, Liu debuted a striking platinum, shimmering costume inspired by Lady Gaga's 2009 VMA performance. Her new program featured a dynamic mix of "Chromatica," "Paparazzi," and "Bad Romance," showcasing a bold artistic direction. Liu had earlier set a U.S. championship record with her short program score of 81.11, a record that was subsequently broken by Glenn.

#### Isabeau Levito's Strong Contention

Isabeau Levito, another fan favorite, continued to impress after her stellar short program. She was part of the elite trio expected to make a strong case for the 2026 Winter Olympics team. Her free skate performance, scheduled for 10:27 p.m. ET, was crucial for solidifying her standing among the nation's top skaters.

#### Pairs Competition Leads to Fierce Battle

In the pairs event, Emily Chan and Spencer Akira Howe maintained a comfortable lead, aiming for their second straight national title. However, the field remained wide open for the remaining Olympic spots, with strong performances from pairs like Valentina Plazas and Maximiliano Fernandez, Ellie Kam and Danny O'Shea, and Alisa Efimova and Misha Mitrofanov, intensifying the competition for a podium finish.

### Public & Critical Reaction

The atmosphere in St. Louis was electric, with the trio of Amber Glenn, Alysa Liu, and Isabeau Levito receiving widespread acclaim for their "dazzling" short program performances, which set the stage for an unforgettable free skate. Alysa Liu, in particular, expressed her excitement to reporters about debuting her "totally new free skate" and revealing her new, striking costume—a sentiment shared by her eagerly awaiting fans.

The buzz around the championships was palpable, with fans and critics recognizing the intense pressure and high stakes, especially with Olympic selections just around the corner. The performances were seen not just as competitions for national titles, but as compelling narratives of athletic and artistic ambition.

### Behind the Scenes / Background

Alysa Liu's revamped Lady Gaga free skate was a significant undertaking, a "work in progress for several months." After a less-than-ideal showing at the 2025 CS Lombardia Trophy, Liu and choreographer Massimo Scali decided the program needed to be re-worked. They spent months "refining the music and choreography," eventually leading to the new song choices and the eye-catching platinum costume. Liu acknowledged the competitive field and admitted that incorporating a triple axel into her program had not been a primary focus during training due to the intensity of the competition, but she left open the possibility for the Olympics.

### Significance & What's Next

The 2026 U.S. Figure Skating Championships served as the ultimate proving ground for aspiring Olympians. These championships were the "closing argument" for skaters hoping to impress the nine-person selection committee, who would meet immediately after the event concluded to determine the Team USA roster for the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano Cortina.

The committee's decision, set to be revealed on January 11 at 2 p.m. ET, will consider not only performances at nationals but also results from the past year, including scores, placements, difficulty of the field, and head-to-head matchups. Consistency in performance, rather than a single great showing, will be a crucial factor in selecting athletes with the best chance for Olympic medals. The figure skating competition at the Milano Cortina Games is scheduled to begin on February 6, following the opening ceremony.

The U.S. Figure Skating Championships 2026 provided a thrilling glimpse into the future of American figure skating. From Amber Glenn's pursuit of history to Alysa Liu's artistic evolution and Isabeau Levito's steady ascent, the competition was a testament to the talent and dedication of these athletes. As the world awaits the Olympic team announcement, the excitement for Milano Cortina 2026 continues to build, promising an unforgettable journey to the Winter Games.
